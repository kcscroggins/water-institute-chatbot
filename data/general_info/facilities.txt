UF Water Institute - Facilities and Resources

Main Office Location:
The UF Water Institute is located at 570 Weil Hall, PO Box 116601, Gainesville, FL 32611-6601. The Institute was established on the University of Florida campus in May 2006 as a campus-wide interdisciplinary organization.

Interdisciplinary Model:
The Water Institute functions primarily as an interdisciplinary coordinating body that leverages existing facilities and expertise across the University of Florida campus rather than maintaining standalone laboratory facilities. This model allows the Institute to bring together resources from multiple colleges and departments.

Access to UF Laboratory Facilities:
Water Institute faculty and students have access to state-of-the-art facilities across the UF campus, including:

Aquatic Research Facilities:
- Aquatic Toxicology Core Laboratory: A 1,700-square-foot multi-purpose laboratory designed to hold and maintain aquatic organisms for biological studies
- Water quality analysis laboratories across multiple departments
- Field research access to Florida springs, lakes, wetlands, and coastal systems

Collaborative Resources:
The Institute collaborates with other UF entities to access research infrastructure:
- Florida Climate Institute
- UF/IFAS Nature Coast Biological Station
- Various departmental laboratories in Environmental Engineering Sciences, Soil and Water Sciences, Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, and related programs
- Specialized analytical equipment across campus

Field Research Opportunities:
Faculty and students have access to diverse field sites throughout Florida including springs, lakes, wetlands, coastal ecosystems, agricultural sites, and the Everglades for conducting water research.

Shared Expertise:
The Water Institute's strength lies in bringing together faculty who represent a breadth of water specialties from geophysical, chemical, biological and social sciences, engineering, law and humanities, each with access to their own departmental facilities and equipment.
