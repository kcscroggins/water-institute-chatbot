UF Water Institute - Research Areas

Research Overview:

The UF Water Institute coordinates interdisciplinary research, education, and outreach programs focused on terrestrial water systems and their interactions with human, coastal, and atmospheric systems. The Institute brings together expertise from geophysical, chemical, biological and social sciences, engineering, law, and humanities.

Core Research Focus:

The overarching goals include improving basic knowledge of the physical, chemical, and biological processes in aquatic systems including rivers, lakes, oceans, estuaries, wetlands, soil and ground waters. Research focuses on terrestrial water systems (freshwater, groundwater) and their interactions with human, coastal, or atmospheric systems.

Research Activity and Funding:

During 2024-2025, affiliate faculty with the Water Institute led active research projects totaling more than $164 million and received new sponsored research awards totaling approximately $40 million. This demonstrates the significant scale and impact of water research being conducted through the Institute.

Key Research Themes:

Water Quality and Ecosystem Health:
- Water quality drivers and impacts on public, wildlife and ecosystem health
- Nutrient pollution and harmful algal blooms
- Surface and groundwater contamination
- Ecosystem restoration and conservation
- Wetlands and springs protection

Interdisciplinary Approaches:
Research addresses biological, physical, social, cultural, economic, engineering, management, policy and regulatory aspects of water challenges. The Institute emphasizes collaborative, interdisciplinary approaches to tackle complex water issues.

Innovative Research Areas:
The Water Institute supports emerging areas of water science through various programs including the Graduate Fellows Program, which promotes establishment of research teams with long-lasting research connections. Recent symposia have focused on innovative advances in science, technology, art, education, communication, policy, and management to tackle pressing water challenges.

Specialized Research Projects:
Examples include studies on dissolved oxygen in the Upper Floridan Aquifer, modeling harmful algal blooms, high-latitude hydrology, and water reuse challenges. Research teams work on both fundamental and applied water research questions relevant to Florida, the nation, and the world.
