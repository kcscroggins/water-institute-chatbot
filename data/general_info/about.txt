UF Water Institute - About Us

The UF Water Institute is an interdisciplinary research and education center at the University of Florida dedicated to addressing complex water-related problems through integrated science, engineering, policy, and outreach. It was established in 2006 in recognition of the importance of water issues and the need for interdisciplinary solutions.  ￼

Mission & Vision
	•	Mission: To bring together talent from across UF to understand and solve complex water challenges through interdisciplinary research, education, and public outreach.  ￼
	•	Vision: To be a global leader in developing knowledge and solutions for a sustainable water future that supports both healthy ecosystems and thriving communities.  ￼

Core Functions
	1.	Interdisciplinary Research:
The Institute coordinates research spanning natural sciences, engineering, law, social sciences, and humanities — focusing on water quantity, quality, ecosystems, policy, and human interactions with water systems.  ￼
	2.	Education and Training:
Programs include interdisciplinary graduate opportunities like the Hydrologic Sciences Academic Concentration (HSAC) and student support through research awards and fellowship programs (e.g., the UF Water Scholars Program).  ￼
	3.	Outreach & Stakeholder Engagement:
The Institute works with external partners, government agencies, and communities to prioritize and address water issues, including stakeholder networks and technical review panels. It also supports UF/IFAS Extension water initiatives.  ￼
	4.	Symposia & Events:
UF Water Institute organizes biennial symposiums (e.g., the 2026 Symposium in Gainesville) to bring together scientists, policymakers, educators, and practitioners to share advances and ideas on water challenges.  ￼

Research Impact & Projects
	•	Affiliate faculty lead large-scale interdisciplinary projects — for example, studies on dissolved oxygen in the Upper Floridan Aquifer and modeling harmful algal blooms.  ￼
	•	Total active research funding has exceeded $164 million as of 2024–2025, showing considerable engagement in both fundamental and applied water research.  ￼

People & Leadership
	•	Director: Dr. Matt Cohen, an ecohydrologist with extensive experience in hydrologic and ecosystem science.  ￼
	•	A core team supports research coordination, outreach, communications, and administration, reflecting a broad mix of expertise aimed at connecting science with real-world water challenges.  ￼

Strategic Outlook

The Institute’s strategic planning documents emphasize:
	•	Building diverse and collaborative research communities.
	•	Generating actionable knowledge for water management and policy.
	•	Enhancing interdisciplinary training and stakeholder engagement.  ￼

⸻

In summary: the UF Water Institute is a major interdisciplinary hub at the University of Florida focused on tackling water issues through collaborative research, education, outreach, and policy engagement. It serves students, faculty, and external partners, and hosts major events and programs aimed at both understanding and addressing critical water challenges at state, national, and global scales.  ￼
