Research Focus:
Stephanie Bohlman is a forest ecologist and remote sensing scientist whose work focuses on how forests respond to climate variability, disturbance, and land-use change, particularly in tropical and subtropical systems. Her research emphasizes scaling forest processes from plots to regions, including forest structure and biomass, carbon stocks and fluxes, drought and climate stress, disturbance ecology (fire, storms, land use), and remote sensing of vegetation using LiDAR, Landsat, and MODIS. She studies tropical forests (Amazon, Central America) and subtropical systems, using field data combined with remote sensing to quantify ecosystem responses at scale. Her expertise in hurricane disturbance impacts, drought stress, and fire-climate interactions is directly relevant to Florida forest management and climate adaptation planning.
