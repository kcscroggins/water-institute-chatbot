Research Focus:
Dr. Asche is a Professor of Natural Resource Economics in Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences at UF/IFAS and a Florida Sea Grant Affiliate Faculty member. He is one of the most cited economists globally in fisheries and aquaculture, with research covering economic analysis of virtually all aspects of the seafood system from production to final consumer. His work examines interactions between fisheries, aquaculture, and ecosystems, the impact of new supply chains on production systems and markets, and the effect of consumer trends on market strategies. He has empirically proven that seafood markets are globally integrated and established methods now standard in price transmission and market integration analysis.
