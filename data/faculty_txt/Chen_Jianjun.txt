Research Focus:
Jianjun Chen is an internationally recognized environmental horticulturist and plant physiologist specializing in ornamental and foliage plant production in greenhouse, nursery, and interior landscapes. His research spans plant physiology, propagation, and production systems with strong applied focus, including ornamental and foliage plant production, plant nutrition and substrate management, plant growth regulation, physiological responses to environmental stress, and interior plantscape performance. He works to optimize plant growth, quality, and sustainability under controlled and semi-controlled environments, frequently integrating basic plant physiology with commercial production challenges.
