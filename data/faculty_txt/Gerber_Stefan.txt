Subject Areas:
Landscape biogeochemistry, Carbon cycling, Nutrient dynamics, Climate modeling

Research Focus:
Dr. Gerber's research aims to understand the cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and other nutrients in land ecosystems using modeling tools. His work addresses how humans interfere with natural biogeochemical cycles through pollution, fertilizers, and land-use, both directly and indirectly through anthropogenic climate change. A central question is how nutrient cycles and climate affect terrestrial biosphere capacity to sequester fossil CO2. Research includes effects of prescribed fire on soil microbial communities in Florida rangelands and nitrogen cycle representation in Earth system models.

Teaching:
