Research Focus:
Richard Beeson is a leading researcher in environmental horticulture and plant-water relations, with nationally recognized work on irrigation efficiency, water use, and sustainable landscape management. His research focuses on quantifying and improving water-use efficiency in managed plant systems, including plant water relations and evapotranspiration, irrigation scheduling and sensor-based control, nursery and landscape water demand, container-grown ornamental production, water conservation strategies for urban landscapes, and climate effects on plant water use. He provides the scientific basis for irrigation efficiency and landscape water-conservation practices that support Florida's water-supply sustainability and springs protection goals.

Water Management District Relevance:
- Work directly informs WMD irrigation restrictions and landscape irrigation ordinances
- Supports Florida-Friendly Landscaping ordinances used by local governments to align with WMD restrictions
- Research addresses establishment watering periods (30-60 day limits vs. actual plant needs)
- Addresses groundwater regulation for nursery irrigation and alternative water supply options

Policy Relevance:
- Urban irrigation is one of Florida's largest discretionary water uses
- Reducing excess irrigation lowers nutrient leaching and runoff into impaired waters
- Supports springs protection through urban nutrient load reduction
- Informs water conservation credits and best practices
