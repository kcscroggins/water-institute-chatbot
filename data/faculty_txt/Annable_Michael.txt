Research Focus:
Dr. Annable is a Professor in the Department of Environmental Engineering Sciences at the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering, University of Florida. His research expertise centers on hydrology, water quality, and subsurface environmental processes, particularly physical-chemical processes for field-scale application of innovative subsurface remediation technologies, innovative measurement methods for contaminant and water flux in hydrologic systems, and development of passive flux meters and techniques for measuring interfaces in porous media. His work also addresses humid, shallow water-table environments such as the flatwoods of the southeastern United States, where significant interaction between surface water and groundwater occurs.
