Research Focus:
Peter Frederick is a wildlife ecologist specializing in wading birds as bioindicators of ecosystem health, particularly how nutrient loading, contaminants (especially mercury), and hydrologic alteration affect reproduction, behavior, and population viability in wetland systems. His research areas include wildlife ecology and conservation biology, wading bird ecology (ibis, herons, storks), ecotoxicology (mercury, trace metals), nutrient enrichment and food-web effects, and wetland and estuarine ecosystem responses to anthropogenic stressors. His long-term empirical research, especially in the Florida Everglades, translates nutrient and contaminant dynamics into biological consequences, validating whether nutrient management targets are ecologically meaningful.

Selected Publications:
- "Altered pairing behavior and reproductive success in white ibises exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of methylmercury" (Proceedings of the Royal Society B) - Behavioral and reproductive sensitivity of wading birds to contaminant exposure
- "A historical record of mercury contamination in Florida (USA) as inferred from avian feathers" (Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry) - Long-term contaminant trends from avian biomarkers
- "Pulsed breeding of long-legged wading birds and the importance of infrequent severe drought conditions in the Florida Everglades" (Wetlands) - Hydrologic controls on wading bird reproduction

Water & Policy Relevance:
- Wildlife responses diagnosing nutrient enrichment and food-web alteration
- Mercury mobilization linked to upstream soil and water processes
- Biological validation of nutrient management effectiveness
- Restoration performance metrics for Everglades
- Nutrient loading thresholds supported by ecological evidence
- Environmental impact assessments using sentinel species
- Long-term datasets detecting delayed ecosystem responses
- Science-based wetland restoration and water quality policy support
