Research Focus:  
Dr. Yoon is a physical hydrologist whose research investigates the dynamics of fluid flow and reactive transport in geological media—particularly porous and fractured rock systems.  [oai_citation:1‡geology.ufl.edu](https://geology.ufl.edu/directory/dr-seonkyoo-yoon/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) His work blends theoretical, computational, experimental and field-based approaches to understand how subsurface structure, flow inertia, diffusion, mixing, and geochemical reactions influence transport of water, solutes and energy across scales. For example, his group at the Yoon Research Group focuses on multiscale hydrogeology & geofluid processes, including karst water transport, acid-rock fracturing, and naturally generated hydrogen.

Professional Bio:  
Seonkyoo Yoon received his Ph.D. in Civil & Environmental Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2016) and previously held post-doctoral research positions. [oai_citation:3‡geology.ufl.edu](https://geology.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/220/cv_Yoon.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) He joined the University of Florida as Assistant Professor in the Department of Geological Sciences where he continues his integrative research program in hydrogeology and transport. He leads both the Geofluids Lab and the Quantitative Hydrogeology Lab in the Yoon Research Group, which uses high-performance computing, micro-fluidics, fluorescence spectroscopy and field work to study subsurface fluid/solute dynamics.
