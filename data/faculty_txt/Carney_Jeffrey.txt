Research Focus:
Jeffrey Carney is a Professor of Architecture and founding Director of the Florida Institute for Built Environment Resilience (FIBER). His work focuses on climate adaptation and community resilience in the built environment, particularly in coastal and flood-prone regions. He leads interdisciplinary research and engagement programs that help Florida communities prepare for climate impacts through innovative design, planning, and technology. His research areas include climate adaptation strategies for buildings and communities, urban digital twins for resilience planning, delta and coastal urbanism, community-engaged resilience planning, and the intersection of design and climate policy. Through FIBER, he coordinates university-wide efforts to support resilient design and planning across Florida.
