Research Focus:
Dr. Braswell is a coastal ecosystem ecologist interested in the formation, persistence, and degradation of coastal ecosystems within the context of surrounding terrestrial, marine, and urban systems. She uses geospatial data analysis and empirical field data to understand these complex socio-environmental systems. Her interdisciplinary research links ecological, geomorphic, and demographic data within a macroscale ecology framework. Through her cross-appointment with Florida Sea Grant, she works with stakeholders to create tools for coastal watershed and ecosystem management.

Notable Achievements:
- Gulf Research Program Fellow (Environmental Protection and Stewardship Track)
- Research on how small natural and living shorelines protect coastal areas from storm waves and erosion
- Previously Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Earth Lab, CIRES, University of Colorado Boulder
