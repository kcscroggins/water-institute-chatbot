Research Focus:
Dr. Wright is a soil scientist best known for his work on soil physical, chemical, and biological properties, with particular emphasis on soil organic matter, nutrient availability, and soil health in managed agricultural systems. His research addresses how soil management practices influence productivity and environmental outcomes, especially in Florida's sandy soils and subtropical production systems. He employs field and laboratory measurement of soil physical and chemical properties, soil organic matter fractionation and carbon analysis, nutrient extraction and fertility assessment, evaluation of management practices including fertilization amendments and cropping systems, and long-term and applied field experiments. Research systems include Florida agricultural soils especially sandy and low-organic-matter soils, horticultural and row-crop production systems, and subtropical agroecosystems where soil constraints strongly shape outcomes.

Notable Publications:
- Effects of management practices on soil carbon and organic matter pools
- Relationships between soil physical condition and nutrient dynamics
- Soil fertility constraints in sandy subtropical soils
- Indicators and measurement of soil health
- Publications in soil science and agronomy journals
- Work supporting management recommendations and extension guidance for Florida producers

Policy Relevance:
Wright's research provides the scientific basis for soil management and fertility recommendations that support sustainable production and environmental stewardship. He contributes foundational applied soil science that directly informs how soils are managed for productivity, resilience, and environmental performance. His work influences soil management and fertility practices, understanding of soil constraints in subtropical systems, and translation of soil science into producer-facing recommendations.
