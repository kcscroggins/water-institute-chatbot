Research Focus:
Dr. Shukla is known for his research in hydrology, watershed and stormwater management, nonpoint source pollution, soil erosion, and environmental systems modeling, with a strong focus on integrating physical processes with environmental quality and agricultural landscapes. He has made foundational contributions to understanding how water and sediment move across landscapes, how agricultural practices influence runoff and pollutant transport, and how models can be used for watershed planning and decision support. He employs development and application of hydrologic and sediment transport models, field measurement and monitoring of watershed processes, analysis and partitioning of runoff sediment yield and pollutant fluxes, and integration of models with management decision frameworks. Research systems include agricultural watersheds and forested catchments, urbanizing watersheds impacted by land-use change, and Florida and southeastern US landscapes.

Notable Publications:
- Development and evaluation of watershed models addressing runoff sediment and nutrient transport - Water Resources Research
- Studies linking agricultural practices to water quality outcomes - Journal of Hydrology
- Research on stormflow generation mechanisms and soil erosion dynamics - Hydrological Processes
- Integration of hydrologic processes into decision support for land and water management - Transactions of the ASABE
- Thousands of citations with substantial h-index reflecting sustained influence

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Shukla's research supports evidence-based watershed planning and water quality policy by quantifying how land management and hydrologic processes interact to shape runoff, sediment yield, and pollutant transport. His research directly addresses how water moves across landscapes and how sediments and pollutants are generated and transported, which are core components of soil and water quality systems. His modeling and empirical work inform predictive and management frameworks for addressing watershed and agricultural impacts. His work influences watershed modeling and decision support, understanding of runoff and sediment dynamics, and evidence for agricultural conservation practices and water policy.
