Research Focus:
Young Gu Her is an agro-hydrologic modeler specializing in watershed-scale simulation of nutrient and sediment transport under management and climate scenarios. His research areas include watershed hydrology and water-quality modeling, nutrient and sediment transport simulation, agroecosystem and landscape-scale modeling (e.g., SWAT and related frameworks), climate and land-use change scenario analysis, and decision-support systems for water management. His work emphasizes scenario analysis to evaluate how land management, climate variability, and policy choices affect water quality, developing models and decision-support tools that agencies, planners, and researchers use to test nutrient-reduction strategies.

Selected Publications:
- Development and application of watershed-scale models quantifying nutrient loads and reduction potential under alternative BMPs
- Studies evaluating climate variability and land-use change impacts on hydrology and nutrient export
- Contributions to decision-support frameworks for watershed planning and regulatory assessment

Water & Policy Relevance:
- Direct modeling and quantification of nutrient loss (N, P) from agricultural landscapes
- Resolving how hydrology, management, and climate control nutrient export
- Nutrient-load estimation and scenario testing
- BMP effectiveness evaluation through simulation
- Watershed planning and regulatory modeling support
- TMDL development and compliance assessment
- Stress-testing nutrient policies before implementation
- Climate change impact assessment on water quality
