Research Focus:
Dr. Klizentyte is an Assistant Professor specializing in economic valuation of ecosystem services and natural resource policy analysis. She uses stated and revealed preference models to assess public preferences and economic tradeoffs connected to environmental management decisions such as conservation programs, recreation, and land use change. Her research generates quantitative evidence on values and preferences that inform policy design and evaluation for natural resource management, especially where economic incentives and ecosystem services intersect.

Water Institute Relevance:
Dr. Klizentyte's work on valuation and preferences directly informs design and acceptance of conservation programs that influence land management practices affecting water quality, aquifer health, and ecosystem services. Her research on the Upper Floridan Aquifer quantifies public willingness to pay for groundwater conservation—essential for designing incentive programs like nutrient management payment schemes. By understanding what society values regarding water and ecosystem services, her work helps predict public support and economic feasibility of policies that reduce nutrient and pollutant loss into Florida's water systems.

Role in Research-to-Policy Pipeline:
Structural/governance layer. Produces evidence on public willingness to support management programs (e.g., aquifer conservation, BMP incentives) that directly impact soil and water quality governance.

Strategic Value:
Answers the question: "What is society willing to pay for water and ecosystem services benefits?" Influences ecosystem service program design, payment structures, public acceptance of conservation policy, and integration of economic and ecological objectives.
