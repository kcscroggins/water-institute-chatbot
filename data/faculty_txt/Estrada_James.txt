Research Focus:
James Estrada is an agronomist whose research focuses on soil fertility, nutrient management, and crop production systems in Florida agricultural settings. His work centers on optimizing nitrogen use efficiency and developing practical nutrient management strategies that maintain crop productivity while reducing environmental losses. His research areas include soil fertility and plant nutrition, nitrogen management and use efficiency, crop production system optimization, nutrient cycling in agricultural systems, and fertilizer timing and placement strategies. His work directly supports agricultural BMPs by identifying practices that reduce nutrient losses to groundwater and surface water while sustaining farm profitability.
