Name: Gregory Kiker
Role: Affiliate Faculty, UF Water Institute
Academic Unit: Agricultural and Biological Engineering
Email: gkiker@ufl.edu

Subject Areas:
Ecological modeling, Water systems management, Environmental decision analysis, Adaptive management

Education:
- Ph.D. Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Cornell University (1998)
- M.S. Agricultural and Biological Engineering, University of Florida (1992)
- Fulbright Scholar for climate change research, South Africa (1992-1993)

Research Focus:
Dr. Kiker focuses on ecological modeling and management of natural systems. His work addresses the need for effective management of valued resources in uncertain environments through integration of ecological, hydrological, and decision modeling. Notable research includes the Florida-Georgia dispute over the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint Rivers, development of stakeholder-derived water system models, and coastal systems challenges.

Current Role:
- Interim Chair, Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (January 2025)
- Graduate Coordinator and spearhead of online Master's program
- Former Research Physical Scientist, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (2002-2005)

Keywords:
Ecological modeling; water systems management; environmental risk and decision analysis; adaptive management; ACF Basin; stakeholder engagement; decision support systems.
