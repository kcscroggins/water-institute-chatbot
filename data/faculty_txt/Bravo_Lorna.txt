Research Focus:
Lorna Bravo is a horticultural scientist whose work focuses on sustainable crop production in subtropical and tropical environments, with particular attention to vegetable and specialty crops grown under South Florida conditions. Her research emphasizes vegetable and specialty crop management, nutrient management and fertilization strategies, crop response to environmental stress, sustainable production practices, and yield and quality optimization. She conducts grower-relevant field trials designed to translate quickly into production guidance. Her work supports improved fertilizer efficiency and reduced nutrient losses under South Florida's high rainfall and sandy/organic soil conditions.
