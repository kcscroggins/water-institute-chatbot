Research Focus:
Dr. Paul A. Mueller is an internationally recognized geochemist and geochronologist specializing in the chemical and geodynamic evolution of the Earth's crust and mantle, with a focus on isotope systematics (U-Pb, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, Lu-Hf) in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. His work provides fundamental constraints on continental crust formation, tectonic evolution, and early Earth processes. Research systems include Precambrian terranes globally (e.g., Wyoming province, southern Appalachians), ancient continental crust and orogenic systems, and integration of field samples with laboratory isotope measurements. His publication record spans over 40 years and includes hundreds of peer-reviewed articles across geology and geochemistry.

Notable Publications:
- Trace element and Lu-Hf systematics in Hadean-Archean detrital zircons: Implications for crustal evolution (Journal of Geology, 2012)
- Paleoproterozoic evolution of the Farmington zone: Terrane accretion studies (Lithosphere, 2011)
- 2450 Ma metamorphism recorded in 3250 Ma gneisses - fundamental insights on ancient metamorphic events
- Crustal evolution in the southern Appalachian orogen: Hf isotope evidence (Journal of Geology, 2010)
- Contributions to GSA Memoirs on mantle and crustal processes in the Hadean and Archean

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Mueller produces foundational evidence on Earth's crustal and tectonic evolution using radiogenic isotope systems, supporting advanced geoscience models of continental formation and deep Earth processes. While his research deals with ancient crust and mantle evolution, his fundamental geochemical expertise contributes to broader geological context for understanding sediment parent materials and long-term geochemical reservoirs that ultimately influence surface geochemistry.
