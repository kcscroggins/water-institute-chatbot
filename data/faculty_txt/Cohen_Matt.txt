Research Focus:
Dr. Matthew Cohen is an ecohydrologist with nearly 20 years of experience addressing water resource and ecosystem science challenges in Florida and around the world. His research program focuses on watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry, with an emphasis on wetland processes. Key research areas include:

1. **Florida Springs**: Studying the ecological state of Florida's world-renowned springs (Silver, Wakulla, Rainbow, Ichetucknee), which have degraded dramatically as filamentous algal mats have replaced submersed macrophytes. His work uses emerging sensor technologies to understand nutrient contamination in these aquatic systems.

2. **Everglades Restoration**: Leading research on hydrological restoration of the Everglades and Big Cypress, focusing on autogenic patterned landscapes (ridge-slough patterns) that emerge from ecological interactions. A century of hydrologic modification has altered physical and biological drivers of landscape processes, and his work informs restoration priorities.

3. **Forests and Water**: Investigating the deep links between forest ecosystems and water resources, including how forests regulate water quantity and quality.

4. **Polar Hydrology**: Studying the changing patterns of Arctic and Antarctic stream functions under climate change.

Professional Bio:
Dr. Cohen received his PhD in Environmental Engineering Sciences from the University of Florida (2003), ME from University of Florida (1999), and BS from Swarthmore College (1995). Prior to his doctorate, he worked with the World Agroforestry Center in Kenya. He held research positions focusing on wetland biogeochemistry and hydrologic systems from 2003-2006 before joining FFGS in March 2006.

In October 2023, Dr. Cohen was named Interim Director of the UF Water Institute, succeeding founding director Dr. Wendy Graham. He was appointed permanent Director effective November 22, 2024. As Director, he leads over 400 affiliated faculty members from more than 80 departments and centers across 11 colleges with active research projects totaling more than $170 million.

Dr. Cohen has been deeply involved in the Water Institute since its inception, serving as Chair of the Faculty Advisory Committee, advising two cohorts of Water Institute Graduate Fellows, and being selected as one of the inaugural Water Institute Faculty Fellows.
