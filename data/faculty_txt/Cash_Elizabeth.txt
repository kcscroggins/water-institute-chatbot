Subject Areas:
Social insect ecology, Chemical ecology, Invasive species, Ant communication

Research Focus:
Elizabeth Cash's research centers on the ecology and evolution of social insects, with particular focus on the diversity, function, and evolution of traits involved in communication and group living in native and introduced ant species. She uses an integrative approach combining chemical ecology, behavior, genomics, and functional genetics. Key research areas include pheromone communication, invasive ant biology, desaturase genes in social Hymenoptera, and social immunity through natural antibiotics produced by ants.

Notable Publications:
- Genome assembly of the winter ant, Prenolepis imparis (Journal of Heredity, 2024)
- Research on recognition systems including colony and caste identity in ants

Keywords:
