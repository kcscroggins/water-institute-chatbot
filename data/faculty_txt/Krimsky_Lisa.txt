Research Focus:  
Dr. Lisa Krimsky’s extension and research work addresses coastal, urban and watershed water-resource challenges in Florida’s Southeast District, covering 12 counties from Brevard through Monroe.  [oai_citation:1‡Florida Sea Grant](https://www.flseagrant.org/fsg-directory/dr-lisa-krimsky/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Her programs focus on water-quality protection, harmful algal bloom (HAB) outreach and response, nutrient-pollution mitigation, septic-to-sewer conversion, landscape hydraulics, and water-resources literacy. She uses empirical surveys of homeowners and stakeholders, extension-education frameworks, and field-based monitoring to support public-policy and management responses.
