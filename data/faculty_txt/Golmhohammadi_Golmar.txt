Subject Areas:
Soil-Water Processes, Nutrient Transport, Hydrologic Modeling, Agro-Environmental Systems, Nutrient Fate

Research Focus:
Golmar Golmohammadi is a soil and water scientist specializing in modeling and analysis of nutrient transport and hydrologic controls in managed landscapes. Her research areas include soil-water processes, nutrient fate and transport (nitrogen, phosphorus), hydrologic and agro-environmental modeling, climate and management impacts on nutrient loss, and field-scale to watershed-scale analysis. Her work generates process-level and modeling evidence that feeds into BMP design, watershed assessment, and regulatory nutrient accounting.

Selected Publications:
- Studies integrating hydrology and nutrient transport models to estimate nutrient loss under varying land management and climate scenarios
- Work examining spatial and temporal variability in nutrient export from soils
- Contributions to decision-support and predictive frameworks for nutrient management

Water & Policy Relevance:
- Directly modeling nutrient loss pathways (runoff, leaching, hydrologic export)
- Resolving hydrologic and management controls on nutrient losses
- Predictive nutrient-loss estimates for policy and restoration planning
- Evaluation of management and climate trade-offs
- Scientific basis for nutrient reduction strategies
- Scenario analysis for BMP effectiveness
- Watershed-scale nutrient accounting
- Supporting TMDL and BMAP development through modeling
