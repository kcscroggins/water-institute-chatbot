Research Focus:
Mariola Edelmann is an environmental microbiologist whose research focuses on microbial community structure, metabolic function, and adaptation in aquatic and extreme environments. Her work targets how microbes respond to environmental stressors, including nutrient availability, redox conditions, and physical constraints. Her research areas include aquatic and environmental microbiology, microbial community ecology, anaerobic and low-oxygen systems, microbial metabolism under environmental stress, biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients, and molecular and genomic tools in environmental systems. Her work clarifies how microbial metabolism controls biogeochemical transformations that determine carbon fate and nutrient cycling in water and sediment systems.
