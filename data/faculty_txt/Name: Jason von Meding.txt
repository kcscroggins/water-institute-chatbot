Research Focus:  
Dr. Jason von Meding studies the root causes of disaster risk by examining how built environments, social inequity, governance structures and community vulnerabilities intersect. His research integrates architecture and construction management with disaster studies, emphasizing community-centered, participatory approaches to resilience and built-environment adaptation. He examines how disasters reveal systemic injustices, and how sustainable and equitable recovery processes can be designed and led by the communities most impacted.
