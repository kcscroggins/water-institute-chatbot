Research Focus:
Dr. Ash is a human-environment geographer focused on environmental hazards and actionable earth system science. His research centers on social vulnerability, risk communication, risk perception, and decision-making for weather and climate related hazards in the southeastern USA. He co-leads the Climate Risk and Storm Hazards (CRASH) Lab with Dr. Katy Serafin. Primary analysis tools are geospatial and statistical modeling.

Notable Projects:
- Composite Red Tide Vulnerability Index (CRTVI) - assessing coastal community vulnerability to Red Tide in Florida (2023-2024)
- Tornado Sheltering Perceptions during COVID-19 Pandemic (NOAA, 2020-2021)
- Tornadoes and Mobile Homes vulnerability study (NOAA, 2017-2020)

Keywords:
Hazard vulnerability and resilience; risk perception and communication; GIS and geospatial analysis; climate hazards; evacuation behavior; disaster loss data; Red Tide.
