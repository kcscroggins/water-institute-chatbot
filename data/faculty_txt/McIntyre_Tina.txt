Title: Extension Agent

Subject Areas:
Community education and outreach, Environmental and natural resource programming, Applied sustainability and stewardship practices, Translation of UF/IFAS research into usable guidance

Research Focus:
Tina McIntyre is a UF/IFAS Extension professional whose work focuses on community-facing education, applied environmental programming, and translation of research into practice. Her role centers on stakeholder engagement, outreach, and implementation of IFAS science rather than peer-reviewed research production. She operates at the practice and adoption layer, delivering science-based guidance to communities, land managers, and local decision-makers. Her work serves local and regional UF/IFAS Extension service areas, community stakeholders, landowners, practitioners, and public audiences engaging with environmental and resource topics.

Program Activities:
- Extension workshops and educational programming
- Community presentations and stakeholder trainings
- Contribution to EDIS fact sheets, newsletters, and county-level Extension materials
- Program coordination and delivery aligned with UF/IFAS priorities

Policy Relevance:
McIntyre supports implementation of science-based environmental and land stewardship practices by connecting UF/IFAS research with community decision-making and adoption pathways. Extension programming may include best practices for land stewardship or environmental management that indirectly influence soil and water outcomes. Extension education affects behavioral adoption of practices that reduce nutrient loss or improve soil and water quality. Extension agents play a critical role in implementation capacity, influencing how policies, BMPs, and scientific recommendations are adopted at the local level.
