Her role centers on stakeholder engagement, outreach, and implementation of IFAS science rather than peer-reviewed research production. She operates at the practice and adoption layer, delivering science-based guidance to communities, land managers, and local decision-makers. Her work serves local and regional UF/IFAS Extension service areas, community stakeholders, landowners, practitioners, and public audiences engaging with environmental and resource topics.

Program Activities:

Policy Relevance:
McIntyre supports implementation of science-based environmental and land stewardship practices by connecting UF/IFAS research with community decision-making and adoption pathways. Extension programming may include best practices for land stewardship or environmental management that indirectly influence soil and water outcomes. Extension education affects behavioral adoption of practices that reduce nutrient loss or improve soil and water quality. Extension agents play a critical role in implementation capacity, influencing how policies, BMPs, and scientific recommendations are adopted at the local level.
