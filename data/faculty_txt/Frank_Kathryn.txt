Research Focus:
Kathryn Frank is a leading scholar in urban design, resilience, and landscape planning, with a strong focus on how the built environment shapes environmental performance, human behavior, and ecological outcomes. Her research areas include urban design and sustainability, climate adaptation and resilience, green infrastructure and nature-based solutions, stormwater and runoff-sensitive design, human behavior and environmental performance, urban heat, flooding, and climate risk, and planning and design evaluation. Her work bridges design theory, empirical analysis, and policy-relevant planning practice, studying how urban form, green infrastructure, and planning decisions influence stormwater management, nutrient runoff, climate resilience, and long-term sustainability.
