Research Focus:
Dr. Murie is a marine fisheries ecologist and population dynamics scientist with deep expertise in age and growth, mortality, and bioenergetics of coastal and reef fish species in Gulf of Mexico and southeastern U.S. waters. Her work supports sustainable fisheries management and conservation of exploited fish stocks. Her empirical biological data on fish populations feed directly into stock assessment models, fisheries regulation frameworks, and management decisions for recreational and commercial species. Research systems include nearshore and reef fish species in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic southeastern U.S., with species studied including greater amberjack, grouper, sheepshead, and others important to recreational and commercial fisheries.

Notable Publications:
- Age and Growth of Greater Amberjack in the Gulf of America - comprehensive assessment of sex- and region-specific growth parameters that inform stock status and models
- Nonlethal sex determination methods for greater amberjack - improves fisheries sampling and biological characterization
- Long-term work on otolith (ear stone) analysis and age structure for multiple reef fish species
- Co-authorship on stock assessment supporting models for sustainable fishery management
- Contributions to SEDAR (Southeast Data, Assessment, and Review) regional stock assessment programs

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Murie produces foundational biological insights that inform fisheries stock assessment and management frameworks, supporting regulatory decisions for reef and coastal fish species in the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast U.S. Her work enhances understanding of marine population responses to environmental and fishing pressures, which is vital for ecosystem management where water quality interacts with fish habitat and community structure. Her contributions influence marine resource management frameworks, which can intersect with coastal ecosystem protection.
