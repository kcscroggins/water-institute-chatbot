Research Focus:
Dr. Grenville Barnes is a globally recognized scholar in land tenure, cadastral systems, and geospatial governance, especially in the Global South. His work sits at the intersection of land administration and cadastral systems, GIS, property rights and land tenure security, participatory mapping, informal settlements and urbanization, land governance and policy, and geospatial approaches to social equity. He has led or contributed to land and geospatial projects across Africa (Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, Namibia, South Africa), the Caribbean, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. His work is frequently used by the World Bank, UN-Habitat, national land agencies, and NGOs working on land reform and urban informality.
