Research Focus:
Dr. Schumann is internationally known for precision agriculture and sensor-driven nutrient and crop management, with a long and influential body of work on variable-rate nitrogen management, real-time sensing of tree canopy structure, soil-plant variability, and deep learning applications for weed detection, crop health, and yield estimation. He is a foundational figure in translating engineering, sensing, and data analytics into practical nutrient and input management systems, particularly in citrus and perennial cropping systems, with clear implications for productivity, environmental protection, and input efficiency. He employs ultrasonic and sensor-based canopy measurement, variable-rate fertilizer and sprayer systems, deep learning and convolutional neural networks for image analysis, spatial analysis of soil and yield variability, and field-scale experimentation and production-zone delineation. Research systems include citrus groves in Florida and comparable systems, perennial cropping systems, turfgrass blueberry strawberry and row-crop analogs, and commercial agricultural production environments.

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Schumann's research provides the technical foundation for nutrient best-management practices and precision input regulation, enabling reductions in fertilizer losses while maintaining agricultural productivity. His work defines how modern agriculture operationalizes nutrient efficiency, making it possible to reduce nitrogen losses, target inputs spatially, and align productivity with environmental protection. While not a soil biogeochemist per se, his work directly governs how nutrients especially nitrogen are applied, where they go, and how losses are reduced through precision management, a key leverage point in agricultural nutrient systems. His work influences nutrient application efficiency, precision agriculture technology adoption, decision support for fertilizer and agrochemical management, and AI integration into production agriculture.
