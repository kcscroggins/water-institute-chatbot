Research Focus:
Mysha Clarke's research focuses on human dimensions of environmental decision-making, especially in forest management, urban ecology, socio-ecological systems, and ecosystem services. She uses mixed methods to understand how people interact with natural resources and how social factors influence conservation outcomes. Her work examines landowner adoption of conservation practices, community structures supporting ecosystem services, stakeholder values shaping conservation, and urban and community responses to climate resilience challenges.
