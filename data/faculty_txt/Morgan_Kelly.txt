Research Focus:
Dr. Morgan is a nationally recognized soil fertility and nutrient management specialist known for research on nutrient cycling, nitrogen and phosphorus behavior in agricultural soils, soil test interpretation, and integration of water and nutrient management for sustainable crop production — especially within Florida's unique sandy soils and intensive cropping systems. His work combines fundamental nutrient process understanding with practical management guidance that has shaped fertilizer use recommendations, water management guidelines, and Best Management Practices (BMPs) across Florida agriculture. Research systems include Florida agricultural systems (sandy soils, high rainfall environments), citrus, vegetable, sugarcane, and row-crop production.

Notable Publications:
- Articles quantifying soil nitrogen and phosphorus transformations, fertilizer response curves, and nutrient movement under irrigation and rainfall in Florida soils
- Work on modeling N and P availability and soil-plant nutrient interactions in diverse cropping systems
- Nutrition of Florida Citrus Trees (3rd Edition) - comprehensive nutrient management reference widely used by growers and consultants
- Soil sampling, interpretation, and fertility fact sheets for making fertilizer decisions
- Agronomic BMPs and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) guidance linking nutrient input with water quality outcomes
- 4R nutrient stewardship guidance for crop production

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Morgan produces mechanistic science and BMP guidance that informs nutrient management policy and agricultural practices to balance crop productivity with minimized nutrient loss and improved water quality outcomes. His research directly addresses nutrient cycling, soil fertility, and nutrient loss pathways in agricultural systems, including nitrogen leaching and phosphorus mobility. His work elucidates mechanisms controlling nutrient availability and movement in soils (adsorption/desorption, mineralization, leaching), critical for understanding nutrient retention and loss to water. His Extension recommendations and involvement with BMP guidance support policy compliance and nutrient management regulation at county and state levels.
