Research Focus:
Dr. Young is a cultural anthropologist whose work examines human-environment relationships, livelihoods, and social institutions, with particular attention to how communities navigate environmental change, resource access, and governance. Her scholarship emphasizes ethnographic and mixed-method approaches to understanding how environmental policies and ecological dynamics intersect with everyday social life. She employs ethnographic fieldwork including interviews and participant observation, qualitative and mixed-method research, community-based and comparative analysis, and integration of social data with environmental and policy contexts. Research systems include communities dependent on natural resources, regions experiencing environmental change or policy intervention, and comparative place-based research across various regions.

Notable Publications:
- Social responses to environmental and economic change
- Governance institutions and local knowledge systems
- Equity and distributional effects of environmental policies
- Lived experiences of sustainability and adaptation initiatives
- Publications in anthropology and interdisciplinary environmental journals

Policy Relevance:
Young's research informs environmental and resource policy by highlighting how governance structures and ecological change affect communities, equity, and adoption outcomes. She provides grounded social insight into how environmental policies and ecological changes play out in real communities, helping bridge the gap between technical solutions and social realities. Her work influences social acceptance and equity of environmental policy, understanding of community-level adaptation and response, and integration of local knowledge into governance and planning.
