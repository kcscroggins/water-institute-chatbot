- Research focus on nitrogen cycling and coastal ecosystem processes

Research Focus:
Dr. Smyth is a biogeochemist and ecosystem scientist whose research spans nitrogen cycling, estuarine and coastal biogeochemical processes, nutrient fate and transport, and ecosystem function under environmental change. Her work elucidates how habitat structure, benthic communities such as oysters seagrasses and marshes, and environmental variability including climate change and sea-level rise influence nutrient transformations and ecosystem services in coastal landscapes. She employs field observations and manipulative experiments to quantify nutrient transformation and fluxes, biogeochemical modeling and sensor-based monitoring of greenhouse gas and nutrient dynamics, and integration of ecological geochemical and physical data to interpret ecosystem functioning. Research systems include South Florida coastal wetlands and estuaries, oyster reefs salt marshes seagrass meadows and urban coastal waters, and broader subtropical and estuarine ecosystems undergoing climate and anthropogenic pressures.

- Work on habitat-specific denitrification ecosystem services of living shorelines and carbon and nitrogen fluxes in coastal vegetation
- Over 3,900 citations in soil water and coastal biogeochemistry literature

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Smyth's work informs nutrient management and ecosystem service accounting in coastal systems, providing empirical foundations for mitigating eutrophication, enhancing nitrogen removal, and adapting to climate-driven changes in coastal biogeochemistry. Her research directly interrogates how nitrogen cycles through estuarine and coastal systems, how habitat structure and community composition affect nutrient transformation and removal, and how climate and sea-level change influence biogeochemical processes. Her work influences nitrogen transformation and removal processes, biogeochemical impacts of restoration such as oyster reefs and living shorelines, and understanding climate and sea-level rise impacts on coastal nutrient dynamics.
