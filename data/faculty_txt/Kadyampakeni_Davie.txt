Research Focus:  
Dr. Kadyampakeni’s research emphasizes sustainable water management, nutrient dynamics and precision irrigation in citrus production systems, particularly under the dual pressures of high productivity demands and water-quality constraints. His program develops and implements decision-support tools and best management practices for surface and ground water conservation, drainage/irrigation optimization, and nutrient management in subtropical/horticultural systems. On a regional scale, his work addresses how citrus production interfaces with ecosystem water budgets, hydrologic resilience, and regulatory frameworks.

Professional Bio:  
Dr. Kadyampakeni earned his PhD in Soil & Water Science from the University of Florida in 2012, preceded by an MS in Agronomy (Irrigation) from the University of Malawi (2005) and a BS in Agricultural Engineering (University of Malawi, 2002).  [oai_citation:1‡Citrus Research and Education Center](https://crec.ifas.ufl.edu/people/faculty/davie-kadyampakeni/)  
Before his current role he worked internationally in Malawi and Ghana on irrigation and water-management projects including a World Bank/IFAD assignment, and at the International Water Management Institute in Ghana.  [oai_citation:2‡Citrus Research and Education Center](https://crec.ifas.ufl.edu/people/faculty/davie-kadyampakeni/)  
At UF/IFAS’s Citrus Research & Education Center, he leads applied research on water‐use efficiency, irrigation scheduling, precision agriculture technologies for water and nutrient management, and conservation of soil and water resources in citrus production.
