Research Focus:
Dr. Dai specializes in geodesy, geophysics, and remote sensing. Her research covers detection of tsunamigenic landslides, quantification of volcanic eruptions, coastline mapping, and earthquake focal mechanism characterization using satellite gravimetry. She uses various remote sensing data (GPS, InSAR, satellite imagery, satellite gravimetry) for coseismic deformation studies and machine learning for landslide detection.

Notable Work:
- Paper on Alaska tsunami threat from retreating glaciers (Geophysical Research Letters, 2020)
- Featured in NASA Earth Observatory and EurekAlert
- Published in Remote Sensing of Environment, Geophysical Research Letters, Earth and Planetary Science Letters

Keywords:
Geodesy; remote sensing; satellite gravimetry; landslide detection; tsunami hazards; coseismic deformation; InSAR; machine learning for geosciences.
