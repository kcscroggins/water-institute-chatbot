Research Focus:
Jay Capasso is a specialized Extension agent focused on agricultural water resources and nutrient management in Northeast Florida. He combines research, on-farm trials, stakeholder education, and technology transfer to help growers and county faculty implement science-based water, nutrient, and irrigation best management practices. His work centers on irrigation efficiency and distribution uniformity, nutrient management and soil moisture monitoring including sensor networks, and multi-county water quality and nutrient cycling outreach. He contributes to applied research such as the Sod-Based Rotation Project at NFREC-Suwannee Valley, evaluating how sod-based crop rotations affect soil health, water holding capacity, nitrate leaching, and nutrient cycling. His Google Scholar profile shows 190+ citations.
