Research Focus:
Michael Dukes is one of the leading irrigation and water-use efficiency researchers in the U.S., best known for his work on smart irrigation controllers, evapotranspiration (ET)-based scheduling, soil moisture sensing, and water conservation in agricultural and urban landscapes. His research areas include irrigation engineering and scheduling, ET-based irrigation, soil moisture sensors, smart irrigation controllers, agricultural and urban water conservation, irrigation impacts on nutrient leaching, and water policy and BMP evaluation. His work underpins Florida irrigation BMPs, FAWN-based recommendations, and national standards for smart irrigation devices.
