Research Focus:
Jonathan Dain is a forest conservation social scientist whose work focuses on human dimensions of forest and natural-resource management, including landowner decision-making, conservation policy, governance, and institutional design. His research areas include human dimensions of forestry, forest policy and governance, private land conservation, landowner behavior and decision-making, institutional effectiveness, and conservation program design. His work evaluates whether conservation and forestry policies actually translate into ecological outcomes.
