Research Focus:  
Dr. Jawitz’s research programme addresses **water resource sustainability** within natural and managed hydrologic systems. He develops and applies hydro-ecological and biogeochemical modelling frameworks for watersheds, wetlands, aquifers and urban water systems. His work investigates how human activities—such as contaminant release, land-use change, nutrient loading and water withdrawals—impact hydrologic and ecological integrity, and how remediation or restoration strategies can mitigate those impacts.

Professional Bio:  
Dr. Jawitz is a Professor in the Department of Soil, Water & Ecosystem Sciences at the University of Florida (UF/IFAS). In his role he leads the Landscape Hydrology Laboratory.  [oai_citation:1‡soils.ifas.ufl.edu](https://soils.ifas.ufl.edu/people/faculty/james-w-jawitz/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) His teaching includes courses such as “Water Resource Sustainability” and “Contaminant Subsurface Hydrology”.  [oai_citation:2‡soils.ifas.ufl.edu](https://soils.ifas.ufl.edu/people/faculty/james-w-jawitz/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) His academic training and earlier work have combined soil science, groundwater hydrology and ecosystem services. According to UF Research Foundation sources, his overarching theme is securing sufficient water for human and agricultural users while protecting natural hydrologic systems.
