Subject Areas:
Watershed Hydrology, Nutrient Transport, Water Quality Monitoring, Hydrologic Modeling, Surface-Groundwater Interactions

Research Focus:
Masanori Fujimoto is a hydrologist and soil-water scientist specializing in field-scale and watershed-scale hydrology and water-quality research, with a focus on nutrient transport (nitrogen and phosphorus), hydrologic controls on nutrient loss, and monitoring/modeling of managed landscapes in Florida and comparable humid regions. His research areas include watershed hydrology, nutrient transport and fate (N, P), surface-groundwater interactions, water-quality monitoring and modeling, and effects of land use and management on runoff and leaching. His work directly informs best management practices (BMPs), TMDLs, and watershed restoration planning.

Selected Publications:
- Studies quantifying nutrient loads and export pathways under different hydrologic regimes
- Work integrating high-frequency monitoring, flow measurements, and models to resolve event-driven nutrient loss
- Analyses linking management practices and climate variability to downstream water-quality outcomes

Water & Policy Relevance:
- Measuring and modeling nutrient loss from soils via runoff and leaching
- Resolving how hydrology, rainfall intensity, and soil properties control nutrient export
- Nutrient-loss accounting and load estimates for watersheds
- BMP effectiveness evaluation through field measurements
- Watershed restoration and compliance planning support
- TMDL development and verification
- Event-driven nutrient loss quantification
- Translation of management actions into measurable nutrient export outcomes
