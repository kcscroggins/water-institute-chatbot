Subject Areas:
Coastal hydrodynamics, Salt marsh morphodynamics, Storm surge forecasting, Beach recovery

Education:
- Ph.D. Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Padova, Italy
- Post-docs at Boston University and Penn State University

Research Focus:
Dr. Canestrelli's primary research focus is on numerical modeling of coastal and estuarine hydrodynamics and morphodynamics. He studies the long-term morphodynamic evolution of river estuaries and back barrier basins, with particular focus on salt marsh erosion and progradation. His research also addresses storm surge forecasting, beach recovery modeling, nutrient dispersal in estuarine waters, and the impact of crab grazing on tidal creek hydrodynamics.

Notable Achievements:
- NSF CAREER Award recipient
- Research on how ecosystem engineering by mussels affects coastal ecosystems' ability to keep pace with sea-level rise (collaboration with Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research)

Keywords:
Coastal hydrodynamics; salt marsh morphodynamics; storm surge forecasting; estuarine modeling; beach recovery; sea-level rise; nutrient dispersal; tidal creeks.
