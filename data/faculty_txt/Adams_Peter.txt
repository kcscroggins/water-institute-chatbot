Research Focus:
Dr. Adams is a Professor of Geological Sciences specializing in quantitative geomorphology and coastal processes. His research focuses on understanding the geomorphic evolution of landscapes resulting from the interaction of coastal, fluvial, and tectonic processes. He leads the UF Geomorphology Lab, conducting field measurements and computer simulations to understand relationships between sediment transport, shoreline change, and morphological evolution. Primary methods include real-time instrumentation to examine physical processes, digital elevation analyses to examine landscape form, and numerical modeling to link process and form together. Current field sites include the Florida Atlantic coast, the Southern California bight, and the Kenai Peninsula in South Central Alaska.
