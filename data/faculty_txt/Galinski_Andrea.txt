Landscape Architecture, Regional Planning, Spatial Analysis, GIS Decision Support, Climate Resilience, Green Infrastructure

Research Focus:
Andrea Galinski is a landscape architect and planner specializing in spatial design and visualization tools that integrate water, climate, and land-use data into resilient landscape strategies. Her research areas include landscape architecture and regional planning, environmental and climate-resilient design, spatial analysis and GIS-based decision support, nature-based solutions and green infrastructure, and visualization of environmental risk and systems. Her work translates complex environmental processes into decision-support landscapes and planning frameworks, operating at the interface between science and implementation.

Selected Publications:
- Spatial planning frameworks and design research addressing water management, climate risk, and landscape resilience
- Interactive GIS and visualization tools integrating hydrology, land use, and environmental constraints into planning scenarios
- Scholarly publications in landscape architecture, planning, and design research

Water & Policy Relevance:
- Incorporating soil, nutrient, and water constraints into land-use planning
- Green infrastructure placement for nutrient retention and runoff reduction
- Landscape design controlling flow paths and nutrient transport
- Translation of environmental science into built form
- Climate adaptation through landscape planning
- Visualization tools for water management decision-making
- Nature-based solutions for water quality protection
- Structurally preventing nutrient loss through design rather than remediation
