Subject Areas:
Marine disease ecology, Marine invertebrates, Fisheries, Coral reef restoration

Education:
- Ph.D. Ecology, Old Dominion University
- B.S. Zoology, University of Florida

Research Focus:
Dr. Behringer is a Professor of Marine and Disease Ecology. His research focuses on marine disease ecology and epidemiology, the resilience and restoration of marine communities impacted by human or natural disturbances, and the ecology and behavior of marine invertebrates. He discovered PaV1, a novel virus infecting Caribbean spiny lobsters - the only naturally occurring virus known to infect lobsters. His lab studies cyanobacteria blooms on sponge habitat loss in the Florida Keys and temperature effects on host-virus relationships.

Notable Achievements:
- Lead editor of "Marine Disease Ecology" (Oxford University Press, 2020)
- 2025 Fulbright Specialist Award (University of Zagreb, Croatia)
- 2015 Fulbright U.S. Scholar Award (University of Exeter, UK)
- Joint appointment with UF Emerging Pathogens Institute and Florida Sea Grant

Keywords:
Marine disease ecology; lobster viruses; marine invertebrates; coral reef restoration; cyanobacteria blooms; Florida Keys; fisheries management; aquatic disease epidemiology.
