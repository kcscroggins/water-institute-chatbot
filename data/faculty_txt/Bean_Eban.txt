Research Focus:
Eban Bean is an agricultural engineer specializing in water, nutrients, and agroecosystem sustainability, with a strong emphasis on applied, systems-level solutions. His research focuses on measuring, modeling, and reducing agricultural and urban impacts on water resources, especially in nutrient-sensitive systems. Key areas include nitrogen and phosphorus transport, agricultural runoff and leaching, edge-of-field and watershed-scale monitoring, Best Management Practices (BMPs) evaluation, modeling tools (SWAT, APEX, field-scale nutrient budgets), and climate variability and resilience in agrohydrologic systems. He produces the empirical evidence used to design and evaluate agricultural and urban BMPs and BMAP strategies for nutrient reduction and water-quality protection in Florida.

Florida Basin/BMAP Relevance:
- Santa Fe Springs BMAP area
- Rainbow Springs & Rainbow River BMAP area
- Silver Springs BMAP area
- Lake Alice Watershed Management Plan steering committee member
- Contributor to Florida DEP BMP manuals and practitioner guidance

Policy Relevance:
- Quantifies nutrient loads from agricultural and urban systems
- Evaluates which BMPs actually reduce loads vs. paper compliance
- Provides data for springs protection, TMDL attainment, and regulatory accountability
- Supports FDACS and DEP decisions on priority focus areas and cost-share investments
