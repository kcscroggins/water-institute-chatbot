Research Focus:
Dr. Shankar is known for her work at the intersection of landscape architecture, climate adaptation, water infrastructure equity, and community-engaged action research. Her background combines architectural practice, participatory design methods, and ecological planning, with a focus on inclusive, equitable design of landscapes and infrastructure systems. She employs community-engaged research and action design, participatory design and co-design processes, design communication for equity and inclusion, and integration of qualitative and spatial research with design processes. Research systems include urban and peri-urban landscapes, water infrastructure and climate adaptation contexts, and projects with equity, inclusivity, and community engagement components.

Notable Projects:
- Collaborative research on equity in water infrastructure and climate resilient landscapes conducted at Cornell University
- Participatory design and co-design processes to surface and address community landscape needs
- Projects integrating biocultural diversity and inclusive approaches in landscape design
- Design research publications and conference papers on community and climate adaptation work

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Shankar's research and praxis advance inclusive approaches in landscape architecture and infrastructure planning, equipping communities and practitioners to design resilient environments that respond to social and ecological challenges. Her work engages environmental and social systems through design practice, equity frameworks, and participatory processes, contributing to how landscapes, infrastructure, and communities adapt to environmental change. Her work influences participatory and equitable design methods, climate adaptation and water infrastructure planning, and translating ecological and social research into landscape and urban design actions.
