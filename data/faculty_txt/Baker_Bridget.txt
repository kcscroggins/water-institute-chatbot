Subject Areas (from CSV):  
Aquatic Biology, Ecology, Water Quality

Research Focus:  
Dr. Bridget Baker’s research focuses on aquatic animal health, wildlife disease ecology, and One Health approaches that integrate wildlife, environmental, and human health. She works extensively with aquatic and marine vertebrates—including fish, sea turtles, manatees, dolphins, and other marine mammals—to understand how disease, contaminants, and environmental stressors influence individual health and population resilience.

Her research spans disease diagnostics, aquatic toxicology, pollutant exposure, stranding-response ecology, and linking wildlife health metrics to environmental change. She frequently collaborates with federal/state wildlife agencies and leads health assessments within the UF Marine Animal Rescue Program.

Professional Bio:  
Dr. Baker is a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Wildlife Ecology & Conservation at the University of Florida. She also serves as Co-Principal Investigator for the UF Marine Animal Rescue Program, where she leads field response, diagnostics, and research on distressed or stranded marine wildlife.

Her professional background includes marine mammal and sea turtle rehabilitation, aquatic pathology, wildlife disease surveillance, and contaminant monitoring. At UF she mentors undergraduate and graduate students, teaches aquatic health-related topics, and contributes to interdisciplinary One Health initiatives.
