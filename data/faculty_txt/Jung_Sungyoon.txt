Research Focus:
Dr. Jung's research interests include identification and quantification of emerging environmental pollutants and their remediation using advanced nanomaterials. Her work addresses the significant knowledge gap in standardized analytical methods for identifying and quantifying micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) from real-world environmental samples. Research areas include micro/nanoplastics, nanotechnology, air quality, aerosol, and catalysts. She has also investigated nitrate reduction using Pd-Cu catalysts supported by hematite.
