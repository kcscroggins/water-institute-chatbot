Research Focus:
Nancy Denslow is an internationally recognized toxicologist and toxicogenomics pioneer, best known for developing molecular and genomic tools to detect endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and other contaminants in aquatic organisms. Her research areas include endocrine disruption in aquatic organisms, toxicogenomics and transcriptomics, biomarkers of contaminant exposure, fish and wildlife health, estrogenic and anti-androgenic compounds, and risk assessment for environmental contaminants. Her work is foundational for modern molecular biomonitoring of water quality, identifying sub-lethal biological responses to pollutants long before population collapse or visible ecosystem damage occurs.
