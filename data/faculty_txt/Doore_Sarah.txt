Research Focus:
Sarah Doore is an environmental microbiologist whose research focuses on microbial ecology and evolution in aquatic systems, especially freshwater and coastal environments influenced by nutrient inputs and environmental change. Her research areas include aquatic microbial ecology, microbial community dynamics, nutrient-driven microbial responses, freshwater and estuarine systems, microbial adaptation to environmental stress, and linkages between microbes and biogeochemical cycling. Her work explains how nutrient enrichment reshapes microbial communities, which in turn affects carbon processing, nutrient transformations, and ecosystem health.
