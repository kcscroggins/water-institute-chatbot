Education:
- Ph.D. Horticulture (Stress Physiology), University of Agriculture Faisalabad & Cornell University Joint Program (2011)

- B.S. Horticulture, University of Agriculture Faisalabad, Pakistan (2006)

Research Focus:
Dr. Shahid investigates stress tolerance and physiology of fruit crops including cold hardy citrus, tree fruits, nuts, and small fruits. His work examines how biotic stressors (pests, diseases) and abiotic factors (heat, cold, drought, salinity, heavy metals) affect crop physiology. Key areas include proteomics and metabolomics for stress tolerance, trace element roles in disease resistance, root/scion evaluation, biostimulants, and irrigation management.

Keywords:
Abiotic stress tolerance; citrus physiology; cold hardiness; crop diversification; plant biochemistry; horticultural science; extension education; sustainable agriculture.
