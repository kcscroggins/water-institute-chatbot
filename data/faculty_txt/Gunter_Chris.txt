Research Focus:
Chris Gunter is a horticultural scientist specializing in vegetable production systems and nutrient management for sustainable, high-efficiency cropping. His research areas include vegetable crop production and management, nutrient and fertility management in horticultural systems, cultivar evaluation and cropping systems, sustainable and resource-efficient horticulture, and grower-focused applied research. His work directly targets yield, quality, and environmental efficiency in intensive horticultural production, generating evidence that informs fertility recommendations, BMPs, and grower decision-making.

Selected Publications:
- Peer-reviewed and applied studies on fertility rates, timing, and nutrient-use efficiency in vegetable crops
- Cultivar trials and production guides informing grower choices under Florida conditions
- Contributions to UF/IFAS Extension recommendations and grower outreach

Water & Policy Relevance:
- Direct work on nutrient inputs, uptake, and efficiency in horticultural systems
- Crop management and fertility strategies influencing nutrient loss risk
- Fertility recommendations reducing excess application
- Aligning vegetable production with nutrient BMPs
