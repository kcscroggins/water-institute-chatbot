Research Focus:
Dr. Baker is an environmental toxicologist and director of the WATER (Warrior Aquatic, Translational, and Environmental Research) Laboratory. Her research focuses on One Health approaches evaluating developmentally-based and transgenerational, environmentally-induced disease from endocrine disrupting chemicals and contaminants of emerging concern including microplastics, PFAS, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and personal care products.

Notable Achievements:
- R01 funding from NIEHS to investigate epigenetic mechanisms of endocrine disruptors
- Lead scientist for 2022 Willoughby Expedition through Florida Everglades
- First nonindigenous woman to cross the Everglades from Gulf of Mexico to Atlantic Ocean

Keywords:
Environmental toxicology; endocrine disrupting compounds; aquatic toxicology; One Health; PFAS; microplastics; transgenerational effects; Everglades water quality.
