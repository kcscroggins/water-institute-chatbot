Research Focus:
Nathan's dissertation, "Linking Landscape Hydrologic Processes to Spring Ecosystem Dynamics", investigated potential drivers of change in the primary producer communities of Florida's spring-fed rivers using a multi-scale modeling approach.

His broad research interests include: the intersection of water, energy, food, and the environment; complex system dynamics; ecosystem dynamics and restoration; and the nature of how scientific inferences are obtained from data. He has experience in theoretical, applied, and experimental science in several disciplines, ranging from the development and implementation of mathematical models to the design and execution of field and laboratory experiments.

Nathan applies his multi-disciplinary experience to his research at the Water Institute, which focuses on understanding hydrological, ecological, and social dynamics in karst watersheds.
