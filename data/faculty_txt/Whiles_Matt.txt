Research Focus:  
Dr. Matt Whiles is a freshwater ecosystem ecologist whose work spans headwater streams, wetland ecosystems, and the interactions between biotic communities and ecosystem functions under environmental change. His research includes quantifying the roles that aquatic animals play in ecosystem processes (e.g., nutrient cycling, energy flow), understanding responses of freshwater systems to stressors (such as amphibian declines, hydrologic alteration, land-use change) and translating science into restoration and management of aquatic habitats.

Professional Bio:  
Dr. Whiles holds a Ph.D. in Ecology (University of Georgia) and has held faculty positions focusing on freshwater ecology and ecosystem sciences. At UF, he chairs the Department of Soil, Water & Ecosystem Sciences. He has supervised many graduate students, published widely (~130+ papers) and co-authored a prominent textbook in freshwater ecology.
