Research Focus:
Paul Fisher is a globally recognized floriculture scientist specializing in irrigation, fertilization, and water-nutrient efficiency in containerized plant production (greenhouse and nursery systems). His research areas include greenhouse and nursery crop nutrition, irrigation management (ET-, sensor-, and substrate-based), fertilizer formulation and delivery, substrate physical and chemical properties, runoff and leachate reduction, BMPs for protected agriculture, and decision-support tools for growers. His work underpins industry standards and regulatory guidance for nutrient management in container production, designing systems that deliver the right water and nutrients at the right time to minimize leaching, runoff, and waste while maintaining crop quality.
