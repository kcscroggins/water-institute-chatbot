Research Focus:
Dr. Taylor is one of the world's leading scholars at the intersection of religion, environmental ethics, and ecology, renowned for pioneering work on "dark green religion" - a theoretical framework describing spiritually grounded environmental ethics with deep reverence for nature. His scholarship blends religious studies, environmental philosophy, and social science to investigate how beliefs and spiritual narratives shape environmental values, ethical obligations, and grassroots environmental movements worldwide. He employs interdisciplinary synthesis combining ethnography, historical analysis, philosophical and ethical inquiry, and cultural interpretation, as well as qualitative and text-based analysis of environmental movements, mythologies, and cultural narratives. Research systems include human-environment belief systems worldwide, and the spiritual and ethical dimensions of conservation and sustainability discourse.

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Taylor's work elucidates how ethical and spiritual frameworks, cultural narratives, and environmental movements shape societal responses to ecological challenges, informing values-based dimensions of environmental governance and sustainability. His scholarship provides conceptual foundations for understanding how deep-seated values, spiritual worldviews, and religion contribute to environmental ethics, motivations for conservation, and cultural commitments to sustainability, essential for crafting governance frameworks that resonate with diverse cultural and moral worldviews. His research influences normative foundations of environmental values, cultural and ethical drivers of conservation practice, and interpretive frameworks linking religion spirituality and ecology.
