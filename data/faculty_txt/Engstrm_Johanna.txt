Research Focus:
Johanna Engström is a human geographer and political ecologist whose research focuses on environmental governance, land use, sustainability transitions, and the social-spatial dimensions of environmental policy. Her research areas include environmental governance and policy, political ecology, land-use change and sustainability transitions, human-environment interactions, power, equity, and environmental decision-making, and qualitative and mixed spatial methods. Her work explains why technically sound environmental solutions succeed or fail once they encounter real social and political landscapes.
