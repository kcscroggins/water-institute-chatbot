Research Focus:
Wendy-Lin Bartels is a human-dimensions and social science researcher whose work focuses on how people perceive, respond to, and govern environmental change. She operates at the intersection of climate adaptation, natural resource governance, social learning and decision-making, stakeholder engagement, and environmental communication. Her research centers on decision processes under uncertainty, especially in the context of climate and environmental change. She examines how managers, stakeholders, and communities interpret climate and hydrologic uncertainty, decision-making around water scarcity, flooding, and extreme events, and institutional and behavioral barriers to adaptive water management. Her work explains why technically sound environmental solutions succeed or fail once people and institutions are involved.
