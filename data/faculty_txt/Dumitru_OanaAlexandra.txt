Research Focus:
Dr. Dumitru is a carbonate geochemist and paleoclimatologist interested in reconstructing past sea level and climate changes across glacial-interglacial timescales. An important part of her work is U-series (U-Th) dating by multi collector ICP-MS for precise measurements of U and Th isotopes to determine timing of events and rates of natural processes. Her doctoral research used cave deposits from Mallorca Island for paleoclimate reconstruction.

Notable Achievements:
- 2020 Quaternary Young Investigator Award (MDPI)
- 655+ citations on Google Scholar
- Research interests in paleo sea level, paleoclimate, U-series, and radon
