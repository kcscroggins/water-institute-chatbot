Research Focus:
Dr. Almeyda Zambrano is Research Faculty at the UF Center for Latin American Studies and co-director of the Spatial Ecology and Conservation (SPEC) Lab. Her research centers on human-environment interactions, focusing on social and ecological feedback loops with consideration to sustainability. She examines land use and land cover change dynamics in the tropics and its relation to economic activities, with emphasis on nature tourism as a development and conservation strategy. Her scholarship integrates social and ecological data using geospatial analysis to understand deforestation, forest dynamics, ecosystem services, and socio-environmental drivers of change in Amazonia and other Neotropical landscapes.
