Research Focus:
Joseph Bisesi is an environmental health scientist and toxicologist whose work focuses on contaminants in water and the human health risks they pose, especially cyanotoxins from harmful algal blooms (HABs), drinking water contaminants, and emerging pollutants. His research is highly applied and policy-relevant, covering cyanotoxins (microcystins, cylindrospermopsin), HABs and human exposure pathways, drinking water contamination, risk assessment and regulatory thresholds, environmental exposure modeling, and public health surveillance and response. His research frequently informs health advisories, monitoring strategies, and regulatory discussions. He serves as a health-impact translator, connecting water contamination to measurable human risk and policy decisions.

Selected Publications:
- "Microbiome Composition and Function in Aquatic Vertebrates" (Frontiers in Microbiology, 2021) - Highly cited open-access paper
- "Higher intestinal and circulatory lactate associated NOX2 activation after microcystin-LR exposure" (2020) - Microcystin mechanistic toxicology
- "Beyond cyanotoxins: increased Legionella, antibiotic resistance genes, and disinfection byproducts during harmful cyanobacterial blooms" (2023) - HABs and drinking water treatment risks
- "Characterization of Atmospheric Processes of Brevetoxins in Sea Spray Aerosols from Red Tide Events" (Environmental Science & Technology, 2022)
- Publications in Environmental Health Perspectives, Toxins, Journal of Water and Health, Science of the Total Environment, Environmental Toxicology

Florida HAB & Public Health Relevance:
- Freshwater HAB events in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs (Lake Okeechobee-connected waters, inland lakes)
- Human exposure through drinking water, recreation, and aerosols
- Florida red tide (Karenia brevis) and brevetoxin aerosol exposure
- EPA and state health advisory development
- Cyanotoxin guideline value interpretation
- Decision-making for water treatment, public advisories, and monitoring

Policy Relevance:
- Supports FDOH, DEP, and utility decision-making
- Informs anticipatory risk management as warming and nutrient loading increase HAB frequency
- Links environmental monitoring to health outcomes
