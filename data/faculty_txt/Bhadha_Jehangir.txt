Research Focus:
Jehangir Bhadha is a soil and water quality scientist whose work is central to nutrient management, phosphorus dynamics, and agricultural sustainability in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA). His research is highly applied and policy-facing, focusing on phosphorus dynamics in organic and mineral soils, EAA soils and histosols, nutrient runoff and leaching, Best Management Practices (BMPs) evaluation, soil testing and nutrient recommendations, and water-quality monitoring and compliance science. His work directly informs regulatory thresholds, BMP manuals, and Everglades restoration strategies. As an Extension specialist at EREC, he works directly with producers to translate research into field-ready BMP guidance and supports regulatory compliance without productivity loss.
