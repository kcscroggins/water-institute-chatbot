Research Focus:
Dr. Sheremet is known for his fundamental and applied research in coastal and oceanographic engineering, particularly in wave dynamics, nearshore processes, sediment transport, and fluid mechanics in coastal environments. He has contributed to understanding how waves, currents, and wake dynamics interact with seabed sediments and coastal systems, including boat wakes and their environmental impacts, and how these physical processes influence coastal morphology and ecosystem conditions. He employs experimental and theoretical fluid mechanics, numerical and analytical modeling of wave transformation and sediment interactions, time series and spectral analysis of hydrodynamics, field observations and statistical characterizations of wakes and coastal flows, and integration of hydrodynamic observations with coastal response analysis. Research systems include nearshore coastal environments, Florida coastal and intracoastal waters, shelf and surfzone regions where wave and sediment processes interact, and boat-wake influenced waterways and mangrove and shoreline ecotones.

Notable Publications:
- Observations of large infragravity wave runup and shoaling behavior relevant to coastal storm impacts and sediment dynamics
- Modeling the statistical behavior of boat wakes and influence on coastal sediment mobilization shoreline erosion and turbidity - Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans
- Numerical models for nonlinear wave evolution and wake-bed interactions
- Research on physical drivers of coastal morphological change

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Sheremet's research supports coastal resilience and management by improving understanding of physical processes such as wakes, waves, and sediment transport that influence coastal change and habitat health, informing erosion mitigation and sustainable waterway use. His work addresses wave and hydrodynamic drivers that directly shape coastal environments, including sediment mobilization, shoreline change, and coastal response to anthropogenic forcing such as boat traffic. His work influences physical coastal drivers including waves wakes and currents, sediment transport and shoreline change, and modeling and interpretation of coastal environmental dynamics.
