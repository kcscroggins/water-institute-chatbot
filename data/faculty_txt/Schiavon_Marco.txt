Subject Areas:
Turfgrass science, Water conservation, Drought management, Salinity tolerance

Research Focus:
Dr. Schiavon's research and extension programs focus on environmentally compatible strategies for turfgrass management. His lab investigates potable water conservation strategies for turfgrass areas, including drought-resistant cultivars, deficit irrigation, and alternative irrigation sources. He specializes in water conservation, drought and salinity management, evaluating effects of effluent water on St. Augustinegrass and bermudagrass, and developing best management practices for new turfgrass cultivars.

Extension Activities:
- Leads South Florida Turfgrass Field Day and Expo (200+ Florida turfgrass managers)
- Research on IPM approaches, mineral nutrition, and disease prevention
- Works with statewide team on cultivars like 'CitraBlue' St. Augustinegrass

Keywords:
Turfgrass science; water conservation; drought management; salinity tolerance; effluent irrigation; St. Augustinegrass; bermudagrass; best management practices; Florida lawns.
