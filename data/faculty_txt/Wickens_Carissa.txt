Equine nutrition and management, Livestock nutrition and feeding systems, Digestive physiology and nutrient utilization, Effects of diet on metabolism health and performance, Nutritional supplementation and feed evaluation

Education:
- Ph.D. in Animal Science/Nutrition
- Research focus on equine and livestock nutrition

Research Focus:
Dr. Wickens is an animal nutritionist known for her work on equine and livestock nutrition, digestive physiology, and nutritional strategies that influence animal health, performance, and metabolic function. Her research integrates applied feeding trials with physiological and biochemical measurements to evaluate how diet composition, nutrient timing, and supplementation affect outcomes such as gut health, energy metabolism, and welfare. She employs controlled feeding and supplementation trials, physiological and metabolic measurements including blood metabolites and digestion markers, diet formulation and nutrient balance assessment, and integration of animal performance metrics with nutritional inputs. Research systems include horses as the primary emphasis, livestock production systems relevant to Florida and the southeastern U.S., and managed animal systems where nutrition directly affects health and productivity.

Notable Publications:
- Nutrient digestion and utilization in horses
- Dietary strategies to support metabolic health and performance
- Evaluation of feed ingredients and supplements
- Links between nutrition gut health and animal welfare
- Publications in animal nutrition and physiology journals
- Extension publications and producer recommendations for equine and livestock nutrition

Policy Relevance:
Wickens's research informs evidence-based feeding recommendations and animal management practices that support efficient nutrient use, animal welfare, and sustainable livestock production. She provides science-based insight into how nutrition shapes animal health and productivity, a core determinant of efficiency and sustainability in livestock and equine systems. Her work influences feed formulation and supplementation decisions, nutritional management for animal health and performance, and translation of nutrition science into producer guidance.
