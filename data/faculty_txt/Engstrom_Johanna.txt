Research Focus:  
Dr. Engström’s research centers on **hydro-climatology, large-scale climate drivers, renewable energy land-use, and sustainable water resources**. Her work combines geospatial methods, climate analysis, hydrological data and decision-support modelling to address the interplay between climate variability, water availability, energy systems and land use. For example, she looks at how drought/flood cycles and teleconnections affect water and energy systems in the Southeastern U.S. and globally.

Professional Bio:  
Dr. Engström earned her PhD in Geography (2017) at the University of Florida, following an M.S. in Physical Geography & Ecosystem Analysis from Lund University, Sweden, and a B.S. in Physical Geography (also Lund).  [oai_citation:1‡Geography](https://geog.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/Johanna-CV-2024.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) She joined UF’s Department of Geography as Assistant Professor and is an affiliate faculty member with the UF Water Institute.  [oai_citation:2‡waterinstitute.ufl.edu](https://waterinstitute.ufl.edu/8438-2/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Her academic trajectory includes studies of hydropower production, drought vulnerability, land-use transitions (e.g., abandoned mines to solar farms), and extreme hydro-climatic events such as “precipitation whiplash”.
