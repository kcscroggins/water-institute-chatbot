Research Focus:
Dr. Graham is the Carl S. Swisher Eminent Scholar in Water Resources and founding Director of the Water Institute. Her research focuses on coupled hydrologic-water quality-ecosystem modeling, groundwater resources evaluation and remediation, impacts of agricultural production on surface and groundwater quality, and development of hydrologic indicators of ecosystem status. She also works on climate variability impacts on water resources and stochastic modeling with data assimilation.

Notable Work:
- Quantifying nitrate leaching to groundwater in Suwannee River Basin
- 4,957+ citations on Google Scholar
- Former Chair, Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (2003-2006)
