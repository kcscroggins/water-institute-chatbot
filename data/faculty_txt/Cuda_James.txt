Research Focus:
James Cuda is a nationally recognized biological control entomologist whose career focused on the classical biological control of invasive plants, especially using host-specific insects to suppress invasive weeds in Florida and the southeastern U.S. His research areas include classical biological control of invasive plants, insect-weed interactions, host specificity and risk assessment, integrated pest and weed management, and restoration of invaded ecosystems. His work is foundational for long-term, low-input invasive plant management, especially in wetlands and natural areas.

Water & Policy Relevance:
- Long-term suppression of invasive plants that disrupt nutrient cycling
- Ecosystem recovery through biological control
- Brazilian peppertree control (alters soil nutrients and hydrology)
- Tropical soda apple control (pasture invasion increases erosion)
- Watershed restoration planning
- Nature-based solutions for invasive species
- Reducing chemical herbicide dependence
- Stabilizing soils through native vegetation recovery
