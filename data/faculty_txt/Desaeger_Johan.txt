Research Focus:
Johan Desaeger is a plant nematologist specializing in plant-parasitic nematodes in agricultural systems, with a strong focus on vegetable crops, strawberry, and specialty crops in Florida. His research areas include plant-parasitic nematodes (root-knot, sting, lesion nematodes), nematode ecology in agricultural soils, integrated pest management (IPM), soil fumigants and non-fumigant alternatives, cover crops and rotations for nematode suppression, and soil health-nematode interactions. His work directly informs grower decisions and BMPs for managing below-ground pests while maintaining soil health.

Water & Policy Relevance:
- Root damage from nematodes reduces nutrient uptake, increasing leaching
- Cover crops for nematode suppression also improve nutrient retention
- Reduced fumigation preserves soil microbial communities and carbon
- Nutrient-use efficiency through healthy root systems
- Soil health-based BMPs for specialty crops
- Post-fumigant transition strategies
- Protecting roots so nutrients stay in plants instead of leaching
