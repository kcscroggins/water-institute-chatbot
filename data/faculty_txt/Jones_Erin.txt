Position:
- Extension Agent I – Livestock & Natural Resources, UF/IFAS Suwannee County Extension

Research Focus:
Erin Jones is an Extension Agent specializing in livestock and natural-resources education and technical assistance in northeast Florida. She supports beef cattle, forage, and livestock producers, providing science-based knowledge on livestock production and management, pasture systems, and natural resource stewardship. She also engages youth through 4-H programs in Suwannee County, building long-term producer capacity and agricultural leadership.

Extension Outputs:
- UF/IFAS Extension newsletter content and educational articles on livestock production, forage systems, and producer practices
- Livestock and natural-resource workshops, field days, and technical assistance through Suwannee County Extension
- Educational outreach on animal husbandry, pasture management, and youth agricultural leadership
- 4-H program leadership and youth engagement

Water Institute Relevance:
Erin's work directly influences soil and water outcomes through livestock and pasture management practices. Grazing intensity, forage composition, and livestock nutrient management decisions shape soil nutrient cycling, retention, and potential runoff to water bodies. By advising producers on sustainable forage and livestock practices, she helps reduce erosion, runoff, and nutrient loss to adjacent springs, rivers, and groundwater in the Suwannee River basin—a critical area for Florida's water quality.

Role in Research-to-Policy Pipeline:
Implementation and adoption layer. Serves as a critical link between research outputs and real-world practices, bringing science-based livestock and forage knowledge directly to producers and community members.

Strategic Value:
Answers the question: "Are producers implementing practices that align with nutrient-loss and soil-health goals?" Influences adoption of grazing and forage management, livestock nutrient practices, and youth engagement for long-term capacity building.
