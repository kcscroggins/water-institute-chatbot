Subject Areas:
Applied econometrics; Causal inference; Policy and program evaluation; Environmental economics; Agricultural economics; Market-based conservation instruments; Machine learning for economic analysis

Education:
- Associate Professor, Food and Resource Economics, University of Florida

Research Focus:
Dr. Ji is an Associate Professor in Food and Resource Economics specializing in applied econometrics and empirical policy evaluation in agricultural economics, natural resources, and environmental markets. His work focuses on prediction, causal inference, and program evaluation, often analyzing the economic impacts of environmental and agricultural policies including nutrient management incentives, conservation programs, and market-based instruments. He generates quantitative evidence that directly informs policy design and evaluation, especially on whether environmental and resource policies work as intended in real agricultural and environmental systems.

- Multiple publications on prediction-based economic impact analysis of conservation practices

Water Institute Relevance:
Dr. Ji's expertise directly addresses whether nutrient management and conservation policies actually achieve their intended environmental outcomes. His work evaluates how policy incentive structures translate into observable ecological outcomes such as reduced nutrient loss and better conservation practice adoption. He helps answer the critical question: "Do policy designs actually reduce nutrient loss or improve environmental outcomes?" This is essential for evidence-based regulation and incentive programs affecting Florida's water resources.

Role in Research-to-Policy Pipeline:
Structural/governance layer. Evaluates conservation and nutrient-policy performance, informs design of incentive-based nutrient management programs, and predicts environmental outcomes under alternative policy scenarios.

Strategic Value:
Answers the question: "Which policy instruments most effectively translate scientific recommendations into measurable improvements in soil and water quality?"
