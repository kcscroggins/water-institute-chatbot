Research Focus:
Dr. Daroub is Director of UF/IFAS Everglades Research & Education Center. Her research focuses on phosphorus chemistry and transformation in organic soils under flooded conditions, and use of computer simulation models to predict phosphorus availability. She develops and implements Best Management Practices to reduce phosphorus leaching and transport into surface waters in the Everglades, addressing sustainability of organic soils in the Everglades Agricultural Area.

Notable Achievements:
- SSSA Fellow (Soil Science Society of America)
- ASA Fellow (American Society of Agronomy)
- National Academy of Sciences, US National Committee for Soil Sciences
- Second woman to lead the 100-year-old EREC

Keywords:
Soil and environmental chemistry; phosphorus dynamics; Everglades restoration; Best Management Practices; organic soils; water quality; floating aquatic vegetation management.
