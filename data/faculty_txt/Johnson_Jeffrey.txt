Research Focus:
Dr. Johnson is a Preeminent Professor in Anthropology whose work spans social networks, quantitative methods, cultural anthropology, ecological anthropology, and socio-ecological systems. He applies network models and quantitative analysis to understand human behavior, group dynamics, food webs, and interactions between people and environments. His research frequently addresses marine and coastal communities, fisheries and resource management, and isolated or extreme environments.

Water Institute Relevance:
Dr. Johnson's expertise in social network models and human-environment interactions helps explain how human social structures and behaviors shape ecosystem outcomes. His work on socio-ecological modeling addresses coastal fisheries and human-ecosystem interactions affecting nutrient and food-web dynamics in water systems. His analytical frameworks elucidate decision pathways and social drivers affecting ecosystem resource use, which is essential for understanding the human dimensions of water resource management and policy implementation.

Role in Research-to-Policy Pipeline:
Research producer with interdisciplinary reach. Generates novel analytical methods and empirical insights used by anthropologists, ecologists, and interdisciplinary teams addressing human-environment systems.

Strategic Value:
Answers the question: "How do human social structures and behaviors shape ecosystem outcomes?" Provides network approaches to resource management and interdisciplinary models linking people and ecological outcomes.
