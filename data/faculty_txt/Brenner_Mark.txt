Research Focus:
Mark Brenner is an internationally recognized paleolimnologist and environmental geochemist whose work reconstructs long-term environmental, climate, and water-quality change using lake sediment records. His research integrates geology, chemistry, and ecology to reconstruct past environments, including paleolimnology from lake sediment cores, water-quality history (nutrients, eutrophication), climate variability and change, carbon and nutrient cycling, isotope geochemistry, and human impacts on aquatic systems. He works across temporal scales from decades to millennia, providing the historical baselines needed to understand whether modern environmental change is unprecedented, accelerated, or policy-driven. He has extensive experience in Florida, the Caribbean, and Central America.

Selected Publications:
- Publications in Quaternary Research, Palaeogeography Palaeoclimatology Palaeoecology, Journal of Paleolimnology, Limnology and Oceanography, Environmental Science & Technology
