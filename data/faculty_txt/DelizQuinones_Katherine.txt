Research Focus:  
Dr. Deliz Quiñones investigates the fate, transport and remediation of environmental pollutants and pathogens within built, natural and human systems. Her research explores how anthropogenic activities — including contamination, waste streams, land-use change and disturbances — affect microbiomes, biogeochemical cycles, pathogen dynamics and exposure risk in water systems. She also engages in community-engaged research to reduce environmental health disparities and enhance resilience in vulnerable communities.

Professional Bio:  
Dr. Deliz Quiñones earned her BS and MS in Biology at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus, with a concentration in limnology and microbiology; she received her PhD in Environmental Engineering Sciences (biogeochemistry) from the University of Florida.  [oai_citation:1‡essie.ufl.edu](https://essie.ufl.edu/people/name/katherine-deliz-quinones/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Before joining academia, she worked for four years in environmental consulting as a project and QA manager focusing on risk assessments and remediation. She began her UF academic career in fall 2017.  [oai_citation:2‡essie.ufl.edu](https://essie.ufl.edu/people/name/katherine-deliz-quinones/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Her current appointment is in the Department of Environmental Engineering Sciences and affiliated with Systems Ecology & Ecological Engineering and Water Systems in ESSIE.
