Water Institute Relevance:
Lester's guidance on landscape practices, septic field landscaping, and water quality protection informs decisions that affect nutrient movement and soil health in urban/suburban settings. His outputs dealing with septic systems near springs explicitly connect soil drainage, plant cover, and water quality, touching on nutrient transport and soil structure in human-modified landscapes. The practices he promotes (proper landscaping around soil systems, plant selection, pest management) influence nutrient retention, runoff dynamics, and water quality outcomes at local scales.

Role in Research-to-Policy Pipeline:
Extension/implementation specialist. Bridges scientific knowledge to practical application in landscape management and horticulture, influencing how landowners and professionals adopt science-based practices that affect soil, water, and urban ecosystem outcomes.

Strategic Value:
Answers the question: "How should homeowners and landscape professionals manage ornamental and edible plantings near sensitive soil/water interfaces (e.g., septic fields, springs) to support soil and water quality?" Influences landscaping practices that mitigate nutrient runoff, residential plant decisions impacting soil and water interactions, and public understanding of soil health in landscape contexts.
