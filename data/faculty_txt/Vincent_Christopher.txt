Education:
- Ph.D. in Plant Physiology/Horticultural Sciences
- Research focus on citrus physiology and stress biology

Research Focus:
Dr. Vincent is known for his plant physiological and horticultural research applied to perennial fruit crops, particularly citrus physiology, stress responses, carbohydrate allocation, and production challenges under disease pressure such as citrus greening and huanglongbing. He combines fundamental plant science with applied crop management to inform improved citrus productivity and resilience in Florida's subtropical environment. He employs gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence for photosynthetic analysis, physiological measurements of water relations carbon allocation and tree hydraulics, field and controlled environment studies of crop responses to management and stress, and applied plant science integrated with cropping system factors. Research systems include Florida citrus production systems, tropical and subtropical perennial fruit systems, huanglongbing-affected groves and stress-impacted tree populations, and integrated management approaches for perennial woody crops.

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Vincent's work informs sustainable crop management and adaptation strategies in perennial agriculture by clarifying physiological constraints and responses that drive productivity and stress resilience under biotic and abiotic challenges. He advances knowledge of how plant physiological processes interact with environmental stressors and management practices, enabling better decision support for growers confronting disease pressure such as huanglongbing and extreme weather in perennial systems such as citrus. His research influences crop physiological measurement and interpretation, integration of stress biology with horticultural practice, and evidence-based recommendations for citrus production systems.
