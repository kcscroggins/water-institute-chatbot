Research Focus:
Dr. Andreu is an Associate Professor of Forest Systems at UF/IFAS with responsibilities in both teaching and extension. His research focuses on sustainable forest management and quantification of ecosystem services provided by forests. He works on issues across the wildland-urban continuum, including urban forestry, forest ecology, silviculture, and restoration ecology. His work includes public engagement in urban forestry management and determining urban forest access using criteria from the 3-30-300 rule.
