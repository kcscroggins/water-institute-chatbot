Dr. Narayanan produces deep cultural and ethical insights into religious traditions that can enrich interdisciplinary understandings of human values and environmental ethics.

Cultural narratives and ethical frameworks from religious traditions can inform how communities understand place, stewardship, and social responsibility in environmental contexts.
