Education:
- Ph.D. Fisheries Science
- Research focus on fish population dynamics and stock assessment

Research Focus:
Dr. Patterson is known for his work in fisheries ecology and management, with particular emphasis on fish population dynamics, stock assessment, harvest regulations, and the effects of fishing pressure on freshwater and estuarine systems. His research bridges ecological understanding with management-relevant decision frameworks for sustainable fisheries. He employs quantitative population models, statistical analysis of fisheries monitoring data, mark-recapture and survey-based assessment methods, and decision-support tools for fisheries management. Research systems include freshwater and estuarine fisheries, managed fish populations often in southeastern U.S. systems, and recreational and commercial fisheries contexts.

Notable Publications:
- Estimating fish population status and trends
- Evaluating harvest policies and management effectiveness
- Integrating ecological data into fisheries decision-making
- Publications in North American Journal of Fisheries Management, Fisheries Research, and Transactions of the American Fisheries Society

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Patterson's work supports evidence-based fisheries regulations by translating ecological data into practical management and harvest decisions. He provides quantitative, decision-relevant insight into how fish populations respond to exploitation and management, which is essential for sustainable use of aquatic resources. His work influences fisheries management and regulation, harvest policy design, and population monitoring and assessment frameworks. His research focuses on fish populations and fisheries outcomes rather than upstream environmental drivers, but it is central to understanding how aquatic ecosystems respond to human use and management interventions.
