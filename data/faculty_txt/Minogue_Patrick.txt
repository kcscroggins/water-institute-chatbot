Education:
- Ph.D. Forest Resources, University of Georgia
- M.S. Forest Resources, University of Georgia
- B.S. Forestry, University of Maine

Research Focus:
Dr. Minogue is a forestry scientist and applied silviculturist whose work focuses on sustainable forest management practices, forest vegetation control, invasive plant management, reforestation and forest productivity, and the development and refinement of Best Management Practices (BMPs) to ensure ecologically sound forest practices. His work blends field research on forest systems with extension dissemination to private landowners, forestry professionals, and natural resource managers. Research systems include Southern U.S. forests (particularly Florida pine and hardwood ecosystems), forest plantations, natural stands, managed forestry landscapes, and programs linking forestry production with ecological protection.

Notable Publications:
- Nitrate Monitoring Following Forest Fertilization in the Suwannee Valley Region of North Florida and Implications for Best Management Practices - directly linking fertilization to nutrient leaching potential under forestry conditions
- Studies on slash pine growth and nitrogen leaching potential following fertilization and pine straw removal, quantifying how management influences forest soil nutrient dynamics
- Applied studies of herbicide efficacy for invasive plant control in forest stands (Tradescantia, Arundo donax, etc.)
- UF/IFAS management fact sheets on control of invasive forest plants, forest herbicide characteristics, fertilization guidance for pine straw production, and weed control recommendations

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Minogue produces applied evidence on how forest management practices influence soil nutrient dynamics and water quality, supporting BMP development that informs landowner guidance and resource protection policy. His research on nutrient leaching following forest fertilization, nutrient dynamics under pine straw removal, and forest BMPs for water quality protection directly involves measuring and understanding nutrient behavior in forest soils and their potential to move into water systems. By refining BMPs for forest fertilization and vegetation control, his work contributes to reducing nutrient export and protecting water quality in landscapes managed for timber and forest products.
