Research Focus:
Raelene Crandall is a conservation social scientist whose work focuses on human behavior, governance, and equity in conservation systems. She studies how institutions, incentives, and social dynamics shape environmental outcomes, especially in protected areas, community-based conservation, and climate adaptation contexts. Her research areas include human dimensions of conservation, community-based natural resource management, environmental governance and institutions, equity, justice, and participation in conservation, climate adaptation and resilience, and protected areas and land-use decision-making. Her work explains why conservation practices that affect soils, forests, and waters succeed or fail.
