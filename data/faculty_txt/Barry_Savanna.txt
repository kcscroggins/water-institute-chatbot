Research Focus:
Savanna Barry is a UF/IFAS Extension Agent working at the interface of agriculture, natural resource management, applied environmental science, and community outreach. Her role focuses on translational science: taking UF research and converting it into actionable guidance for producers, land managers, and local stakeholders. She works at the implementation interface of Florida water, soil, and conservation policy, translating research and regulatory frameworks into locally adopted agricultural and land-stewardship practices. Her work supports compliance, adoption, and behavior change for water and conservation programs, which is where most environmental policy succeeds or fails.

Program Areas:
- Sustainable agricultural practices
- Soil and water conservation
- Nutrient management and runoff reduction
- Irrigation efficiency
- Best Management Practices (BMPs) for agriculture
- Producer education and technical assistance
- Conservation program implementation

Policy Relevance:
- Florida Numeric Nutrient Criteria implementation
- Basin Management Action Plans (BMAPs)
- Agricultural water-use efficiency
- USDA NRCS conservation programs
- State soil and water conservation district initiatives

Keywords:
Agriculture; natural resource management; water conservation; soil conservation; BMPs; best management practices; nutrient management; irrigation efficiency; producer education; technical assistance; environmental stewardship; Extension; IFAS; conservation policy; Water Institute affiliate
