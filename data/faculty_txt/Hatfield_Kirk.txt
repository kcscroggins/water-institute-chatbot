Subject Areas:
Hydrogeology, Groundwater Modeling, Contaminant Transport, Nutrient Transport, Subsurface Hydrology

Research Focus:
Kirk Hatfield is a hydrogeologist specializing in groundwater flow and nutrient/contaminant transport modeling in complex subsurface systems. His research areas include hydrogeology and groundwater flow, contaminant and nutrient transport in aquifers, groundwater-surface water interactions, numerical modeling of subsurface systems, and water-quality impacts of land use and infrastructure. His work focuses on aquifer processes, contaminant transport, and groundwater-surface water interactions in environmentally sensitive or managed systems, generating quantitative models and process understanding that underpin groundwater regulation and water-resource management decisions.

Selected Publications:
- Studies on groundwater flow and solute transport including nutrients and contaminants
- Modeling work examining how hydrologic conditions and infrastructure affect subsurface transport pathways
- Contributions to risk assessment and prediction of groundwater quality degradation

Water & Policy Relevance:
- Nutrient transport through groundwater as major nutrient-loss pathway
- Groundwater nutrient delivery to springs, rivers, estuaries, and coastal systems
- Groundwater nutrient-load estimates for regulatory purposes
- Subsurface risk assessment and modeling
- Managing groundwater-mediated nutrient loading
- Understanding nutrient fate after leaving soil zone
- Spring protection and restoration planning
- Water-resource and nutrient-management policy support
