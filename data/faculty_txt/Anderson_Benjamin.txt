Subject Areas:
Zoonotic disease epidemiology, One Health, Environmental pathogen monitoring, Global health

Education:
- PhD in Public Health (One Health), University of Florida
- MPH, University of Florida (Environmental and Global Health)

Research Focus:
Dr. Anderson specializes in emerging infectious diseases with particular emphasis on zoonotic pathogens and viral respiratory illness. His work examines disease transmission dynamics among humans, animals, and environmental reservoirs, with strong focus on vulnerable populations having significant animal contact. He investigates antibiotic resistance in environmental settings and maintains commitment to global health capacity building.

Notable Work:
- 40+ peer-reviewed articles on SARS-CoV-2 environmental detection, influenza surveillance in swine and poultry, tick-borne pathogens, and bioaerosol sampling methodology
- PhD Program Director, Environmental & Global Health (2026-present)
- Associate Director, One Health Center of Excellence (2025-present)

Keywords:
Zoonotic disease epidemiology; viral respiratory pathogens; One Health approaches; environmental pathogen monitoring; bioaerosol surveillance; infectious disease transmission; antibiotic resistance; global health capacity building.
