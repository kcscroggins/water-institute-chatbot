Mass spectrometry, Lipidomics, PFAS contamination, Environmental chemistry, Wildlife health

Research Focus:
Dr. Bowden's laboratory employs mass spectrometric methods at the chemistry-biology interface, with emphasis on environmental contaminant exposure and health outcomes. His work integrates external exposure measures (anthropogenic pollutants) with internal biomarkers (lipids, hormones) to understand disease mechanisms. Current investigations center on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), lipidomics, and metabolomics applications across environmental and clinical domains.

Notable Publications:
- "Statewide Surveillance and Mapping of PFAS in Florida Surface Water" (ACS ES&T Water, 2024)
- "Crowdsourcing citizens for statewide mapping of PFAS in Florida drinking water"
- Multi-omics investigations of coral responses to environmental stressors
- 70+ peer-reviewed articles (2023-2025)

Keywords:
Mass spectrometry; lipidomics; metabolomics; PFAS contamination; environmental chemistry; analytical method development; endocrine disruption; wildlife and human health exposure assessment.
