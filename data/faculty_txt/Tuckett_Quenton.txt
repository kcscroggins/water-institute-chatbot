Subject Areas:
Non-native species management, Aquaculture, Fish invasion biology, Thermal ecology

Education:
- Ph.D. Biological Sciences, University of Maine (2013)
- M.S. Biology, Boise State University (2007)
- B.S. Ecology, Idaho State University (2002)

Research Focus:
Dr. Tuckett's primary research examines ecological and evolutionary factors that limit/promote the persistence and establishment of non-native fishes. Key areas include non-native poeciliid fish species as invasion models, domestication signals across fish species, thermal tolerance in native and non-native populations, aquatic trade risk assessment, and coastal restoration impacts on estuarine species.

Notable Work:
- Behavioral comparisons of invasive Gambusia species
- Thermal tolerance studies for tropical and range-expanding fish
- Screening protocols for potentially invasive aquatic organisms
- Sportfish habitat use and restoration outcomes in Tampa Bay

Keywords:
Non-native species management; aquaculture best practices; fish invasion biology; thermal ecology; ornamental aquaculture industry; aquatic ecosystem disturbance; eco-evolutionary dynamics.
