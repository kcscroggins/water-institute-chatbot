Education:
- Ph.D. Fisheries Science
- Research focus on quantitative fisheries ecology and management

Research Focus:
Dr. Pine is known for quantitative fisheries ecology and management, particularly the integration of population dynamics, monitoring data, and decision analysis to inform fisheries management. His work emphasizes evidence-based assessment, adaptive management, and translating ecological data into actionable guidance for agencies responsible for freshwater and marine fisheries. He employs statistical and quantitative population models, analysis of long-term fisheries monitoring datasets, decision-support frameworks for management evaluation, and integration of ecological theory with applied assessment. Research systems include freshwater and marine fisheries, managed fish populations, and systems relevant to state and regional fisheries agencies often in the southeastern United States.

Notable Publications:
- Improving the reliability of stock assessments
- Linking monitoring data to management decisions
- Evaluating fisheries regulations and conservation outcomes
- Publications in Fisheries Research, North American Journal of Fisheries Management, and Transactions of the American Fisheries Society

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Pine's work helps agencies design and evaluate fisheries policies by rigorously connecting ecological data to management decisions under uncertainty. He contributes decision-relevant science that improves how fisheries are assessed, regulated, and conserved, ensuring ecological sustainability alongside human use. His research centers on fish populations and management systems, providing the analytical backbone for sustainable fisheries and conservation decisions. His work influences fisheries management and regulation, monitoring and assessment design, and adaptive management frameworks.
