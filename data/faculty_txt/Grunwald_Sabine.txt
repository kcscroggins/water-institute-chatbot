Research Focus:
Sabine Grunwald is a soil scientist and global leader in digital soil mapping and soil carbon modeling, specializing in spatial and temporal analysis of soil systems. Her research areas include digital soil mapping (DSM), soil carbon and soil health assessment, spatiotemporal soil modeling, soil degradation and land-use change, human-soil-landscape interactions, and machine learning and geospatial analytics in soil science. She is a foundational figure in data-driven soil science, generating methods, datasets, and conceptual frameworks that underpin soil monitoring programs, carbon accounting, and land-management decision systems.

Selected Publications:
- "Multi-criteria characterization of recent digital soil mapping and modeling approaches" (Geoderma) - Influential synthesis defining the DSM field
- Numerous highly cited papers on soil carbon stocks, spatial uncertainty, and soil data analytics used in carbon accounting and soil monitoring
- "Environmental Soil-Landscape Modeling" (CRC Press) - Core reference text linking soil science, geospatial modeling, and environmental decision-making

Water & Policy Relevance:
- Direct mapping of soil carbon stocks and their spatial-temporal variability
- Methods and models quantifying nutrient loss and carbon dynamics at scale
- Soil carbon accounting for climate mitigation policy
- Land-use and soil-health assessment frameworks
- Uncertainty quantification in soil monitoring
- Scientific credibility foundation for carbon and soil policy
- Data-driven approaches to soil condition assessment
