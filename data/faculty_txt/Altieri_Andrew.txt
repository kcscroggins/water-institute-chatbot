Research Focus:
Dr. Altieri is an Associate Professor in Environmental Engineering Sciences and Interim Director at the Center for Coastal Solutions, where he leads the nature-based solutions program. His research examines how global drivers including habitat degradation, species invasions, extinctions, and overexploitation have cascading effects on biodiversity and emergent properties of coastal ecosystems. He employs an interdisciplinary combination of field experiments, large-scale observations, historical reconstruction, and ecophysiology techniques integrating from organism to seascape. Much of his current research focuses on ocean deoxygenation and how it affects habitat-forming species including corals, examining how dissolved oxygen depletion causes hypoxia-induced stress and mortality for scleractinian corals.
