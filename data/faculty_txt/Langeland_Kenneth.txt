Education:
- Ph.D.
- Professor Emeritus, Agronomy, University of Florida

Research Focus:
Dr. Langeland is a Professor Emeritus specializing in aquatic and invasive plant management. His extensive career has focused on weed ecology, invasive species control, and integrated plant management, especially in Florida's natural and managed ecosystems. He produces actionable guidance through EDIS fact sheets, management plans, and technical reports on invasive plant management and integrated plant control that inform land managers, conservation practitioners, and policy.

Notable Publications and Outputs:
- Brazilian Peppertree Control: SS-AGR-17/AA219 - invasive tree biology and management
- Natural Area Weeds: Skunkvine (Paederia foetida): SS-AGR-80/WG208 - invasive wetland species management
- Herbicides to Kill Invasive Trees in Home Landscapes: SS-AGR-127/AG259
- Natural Area Weeds: Melaleuca Control: SS-AGR-96/AG241
- Integrated Management of Non-Native Plants in Natural Areas of Florida - comprehensive weed management plan
- Identification & Biology of Non-Native Plants in Florida's Natural Areas (193-page reference book)

Water Institute Relevance:
Dr. Langeland's expertise in aquatic and invasive plant management directly supports water resource protection. Invasive aquatic plants can alter hydrology, water quality, and nutrient dynamics in Florida's lakes, rivers, and wetlands. Effective invasive plant control is essential for maintaining native ecosystem function, water flow, and the ecological services that healthy aquatic systems provide. His management guidance shapes how land managers address invasive vegetation that impacts water bodies and associated ecosystems throughout Florida.

Role in Research-to-Policy Pipeline:
Applied research producer and Extension specialist. Produces practical management guidance that supports conservation policy and ecosystem stewardship by enabling effective invasive species control and informed plant management decisions.

Strategic Value:
Answers the question: "How can non-native and invasive plants be managed effectively to preserve native ecosystems and maintain landscape function?" Influences land and vegetation management practice, invasive species policy, and restoration planning for natural areas and aquatic systems.
