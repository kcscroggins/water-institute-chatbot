Research Focus:
Bryndan Durham is a marine microbial ecologist whose work focuses on bacterioplankton, microbial food webs, and nutrient cycling in marine and estuarine systems, particularly the Gulf of Mexico and coastal oceans. His research areas include marine and estuarine microbial ecology, bacterioplankton dynamics, carbon cycling and microbial respiration, nitrogen and phosphorus utilization, microbial food webs, and responses of microbes to nutrient enrichment and environmental change. His work explains how microbial community composition and metabolism regulate carbon and nutrient fluxes in aquatic ecosystems.
