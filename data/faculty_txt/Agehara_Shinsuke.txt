Research Focus:
Dr. Agehara is an Associate Professor of Horticulture who leads the Agehara Lab at GCREC. His research and extension program focuses on developing vegetable and fruit production practices to improve productivity, product quality, stress tolerance, and resource use efficiency—especially under environmental stresses such as heat, water, and nutrient limitations. The program covers Florida's major crops including tomato, strawberry, blueberry, bell pepper, and cucurbits, as well as specialty crops such as blackberry, pomegranate, hops, hemp, and artichoke. Core research themes include plant adaptive responses to environmental changes and abiotic stresses, irrigation and fertilization practices for sustainability, cultural management and protected agriculture, and integration of advanced techniques such as remote sensing, image-based diagnostics, and crop modeling.
