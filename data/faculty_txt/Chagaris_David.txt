Research Focus:
David Chagaris is an expert in ecosystem-based fisheries science who develops and applies quantitative food-web and ecosystem models to understand how marine fish populations and broader ecosystems respond to fishing pressure, environmental change, policy options and management strategies, and trophic interactions and predator-prey dynamics. He combines mechanistic models (e.g., Ecopath with Ecosim) with empirical data to inform science-based decision making in marine resource management. His research is especially relevant to Gulf of Mexico and West Florida Shelf marine ecosystems, which tie into coastal ecology, climate influences, and fisheries sustainability.
