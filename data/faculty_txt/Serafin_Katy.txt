Research Focus:  
Dr. Katy Serafin is a coastal scientist whose work examines **extreme sea levels, compound coastal flooding hazards, and human-natural coupled systems** in a changing climate. She blends observational datasets, statistical and numerical modelling to delineate the frequency, drivers and impacts of coastal flooding and erosion events. Her current research includes analyses of compound flooding (e.g., simultaneous wave runup + storm surge + high tide), atmospheric‐river flood damage trends, and socio-hydrologic risk trajectories for coastal communities.

Professional Bio:  
Katy Serafin earned her PhD in Ocean, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences (Oregon State University, 2017), followed by a post-doctoral appointment in the Department of Geophysics at Stanford University (2018–2019).  [oai_citation:1‡Geography](https://geog.ufl.edu/directory/dr-katy-serafin/) She joined the University of Florida as Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography, holds affiliate faculty status with the UF Water Institute and Florida Climate Institute, and conducts interdisciplinary research spanning hydrology, climate sciences, geospatial analytics, and risk assessment.  [oai_citation:2‡Geography](https://geog.ufl.edu/directory/dr-katy-serafin/) She teaches courses including GEO 2230 “Living with Rising Seas”, GEO 3222 “Sea Level Science”, and GEO 4285/6938 “Water Risk and Extreme Events”.
