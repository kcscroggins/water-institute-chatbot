Research Focus:  
Dr. Kaplan’s research examines the **linkages among the hydrologic cycle, ecosystem processes and human activities**, with a focus on wetland, watershed and freshwater‐coastal interface systems.  [oai_citation:1‡essie.ufl.edu](https://essie.ufl.edu/people/name/david-kaplan/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) He leads the Watershed Ecology Lab at UF, exploring how changes in land use, water withdrawals, restoration efforts, nutrient loads and climate variability influence hydrology, ecosystem function and management outcomes.  [oai_citation:2‡watershedecology.org](https://www.watershedecology.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
His work spans hydrologic modelling, ecosystem services assessment, wetland restoration, and decision support for water resource and environmental management agencies.  [oai_citation:3‡University of Florida Experts](https://experts.ufl.edu/experts/david.kaplan/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

Professional Bio:  
Dr. Kaplan earned his B.S. from Cornell University in 2000 and his Ph.D. from the University of Florida in 2010.  [oai_citation:4‡essie.ufl.edu](https://essie.ufl.edu/people/name/david-kaplan/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) He is Associate Professor in the Department of Environmental Engineering Sciences at UF/ESSIE, and directs the H. T. Odum Center for Wetlands.  [oai_citation:5‡essie.ufl.edu](https://essie.ufl.edu/people/name/david-kaplan/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) His lab hosts researchers investigating subjects like groundwater‐surface water coupling, wetland ecohydrology, nutrient cycling, restoration outcomes and climate impacts on water systems.
