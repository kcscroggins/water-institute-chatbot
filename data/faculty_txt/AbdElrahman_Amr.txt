Research Focus:
Dr. Abd-Elrahman is an Associate Professor of Geomatics whose research focuses on remote sensing and geospatial analysis applications in precision agriculture and natural resource management. He utilizes multi-spectral and hyperspectral images acquired from satellite, airborne, and small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) as well as LiDAR datasets. He uses machine learning algorithms, including deep learning networks (CNN, FCN, Deeplab) to analyze high spatial resolution sUAS images for wetland classification, vegetation analysis, and ecosystem monitoring.
