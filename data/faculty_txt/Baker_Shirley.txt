Research Focus:
Dr. Shirley M. Baker is a Professor of Molluscan Biology and Aquaculture in the Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences Program at UF. Her research bridges physiology, ecology, and aquaculture of marine invertebrates, especially shellfish. She focuses on understanding shellfish (e.g., hard clams, oysters) physiological responses to environmental factors, including the effects of salinity, temperature, water quality, and eutrophication on shellfish performance and ecosystem services. Her work includes developing models to predict impacts of environmental parameters on shellfish productivity and studying ecosystem services provided by shellfish, including nutrient cycling and water quality improvement. Her extension work supports the shellfish and aquaculture industries, citizens, and stakeholders throughout Florida by identifying industry needs, conducting applied research, and providing sustainable solutions.
