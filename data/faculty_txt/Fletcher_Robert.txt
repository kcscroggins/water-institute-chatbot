Research Focus:
Robert Fletcher is an internationally recognized landscape ecologist and conservation scientist whose work focuses on how spatial patterns, habitat connectivity, and human land use affect biodiversity and ecosystem function. His research areas include landscape ecology, habitat fragmentation and connectivity, metapopulation and community dynamics, conservation planning and reserve design, human land use impacts, ecosystem services and biodiversity outcomes, and spatial modeling and synthesis. His work is foundational for translating land-use patterns into ecological consequences, connecting land management decisions to ecological resilience, species persistence, and ecosystem services across space and time.
