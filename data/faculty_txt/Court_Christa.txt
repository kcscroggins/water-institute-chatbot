Research Focus:  
Dr. Court’s work emphasizes **regional economic modeling of human-natural system interactions**, with particular strength in disaster impact analysis for agriculture, forestry, fisheries, coastal and food industries. Her research program within the Economic Impact Analysis Program (EIAP) focuses on quantifying short- and long-term economic impacts of events such as hurricanes, harmful algal blooms, oil spills, pandemics and other stressors on Florida’s natural-resource and food sectors.  [oai_citation:0‡fred.ifas.ufl.edu](https://fred.ifas.ufl.edu/about/directory/christa-court/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
She applies integrated economic-impact methods (e.g., input-output modeling, IMPLAN, econometrics) to assess **economic contributions, losses, and resilience** of industry sectors tied to water, natural resources, food systems, and disaster events. Her outputs include extension reports, fact sheets, and peer-reviewed journal articles aimed at informing policy, stakeholder management and resilience planning.  [oai_citation:1‡Ask IFAS - Powered by EDIS](https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/experts/ccourt?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
