Research Focus:
Brent Christner is an internationally recognized environmental microbiologist studying microbial life in extreme environments, particularly cold ecosystems such as glaciers, snow, ice cores, and the atmosphere. His work spans microbiology, Earth science, and climate processes, including microbial ecology of ice, snow, and glacial systems, atmospheric microbiology (microbes in clouds, precipitation, aerosols), ice-nucleating bacteria and proteins, biogeochemical cycling in extreme environments, and microbial survival and activity at low temperatures. His research integrates field sampling, molecular biology, and geochemical analysis to understand how microorganisms influence and are influenced by cryosphere processes, atmospheric chemistry, and biogeochemical cycles.
