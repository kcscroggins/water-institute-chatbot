Research Focus:
Jonathan Crane is a nationally and internationally recognized tropical fruit horticulturist whose work centers on production systems, cultivar performance, and management of tropical and subtropical fruit crops in South Florida. His expertise spans tropical and subtropical fruit crops (mango, avocado, lychee, longan, sapodilla, jackfruit), crop nutrition and fertilization, irrigation and water management, soil management in calcareous (rockland) soils, cultivar evaluation and performance, and orchard establishment and management. His work is deeply tied to South Florida's limestone-based soils, which behave very differently from typical mineral soils in terms of nutrient retention and loss.

Water & Policy Relevance:
- Nutrient management for tropical orchards on calcareous soils
- Low nutrient retention in limestone soils
- Nitrogen and potassium leaching risks in tropical fruit systems
- Split fertilizer applications to reduce nutrient losses
- Irrigation scheduling to reduce leaching and runoff
