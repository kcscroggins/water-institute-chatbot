Subject Areas:
Climate risk assessment, Disaster resilience, Hydroclimate systems, Infrastructure planning

Research Focus:
Dr. Najibi specializes in enhancing climate risk assessments and disaster resilience in built and environmental systems. His work centers on three core areas: (1) Multisectoral-Multiscale Risks - analyzing hydroclimate extremes (floods, droughts, precipitation events, heat/cold waves) affecting natural and built environments; (2) Climate Resilience Adaptation - developing stochastic decision models for infrastructure and ecosystem responses; (3) Climate Vulnerability Assessment - combining process-based insights with ensemble frameworks.

Keywords:
Hydroclimate systems analysis; natural hazards and disaster resilience; climate adaptation and sustainability; infrastructure planning and management; stochastic decision-making under uncertainty; systems resilience.
