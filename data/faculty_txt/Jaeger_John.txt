Research Focus:
John Jaeger is a geologist specializing in sedimentology, stratigraphy, and coastal/nearshore geologic processes, with emphasis on sediment transport, deposition, and landscape evolution in fluvial, deltaic, and coastal systems. His research areas include sedimentology and stratigraphy, coastal and nearshore processes, fluvial-deltaic systems, sediment transport and deposition, and landscape evolution and geomorphology. His work clarifies how physical earth processes control material fluxes that shape environments over time, providing process-level geologic understanding that underpins coastal management, hazard assessment, and sediment-based restoration planning.

Selected Publications:
- Empirical and modeling studies of sediment transport and deposition in coastal and fluvial systems
- Research linking hydrodynamics and sediment budgets to coastal morphology and change
- Contributions to Geology, Journal of Sedimentary Research, Marine Geology, and related venues
