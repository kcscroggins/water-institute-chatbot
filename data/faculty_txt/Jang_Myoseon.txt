Research Focus:
Dr. Jang is an Associate Professor in Environmental Engineering Sciences specializing in atmospheric chemistry and aerosol science. Her research focuses on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, multiphase reactions of atmospheric pollutants, and the impacts of airborne particulates on health and climate. She combines experimental chamber work, modeling, and photochemical simulations to characterize aerosol processes. Her work provides quantitative understanding of aerosol processes that inform air quality modeling, pollution regulation, and climate forcing assessments.

Water Institute Relevance:
Dr. Jang's expertise in atmospheric chemistry connects to water systems through nutrient deposition pathways. Atmospheric aerosols contribute to deposition of nitrogen (ammonium, nitrate) and other nutrients to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, affecting biogeochemical cycles. Her work on aerosol formation, pollutant transformation, and atmospheric chemistry influences nutrient cycling and is a key component of integrated nutrient-cycle models. Understanding how airborne pollutants form, transform, and deposit helps explain nutrient loading to water bodies from atmospheric sources.

Role in Research-to-Policy Pipeline:
