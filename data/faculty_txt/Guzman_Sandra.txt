Research Focus:
Dr. Guzman's research addresses gaps in irrigation technology adoption, nutrient management, and hydrology. Her smart irrigation and hydrology laboratory develops practical Decision Support Systems and technologies. She developed IrrigMonitor, a centralized application integrating multiple sensor data for irrigation assessment. Current work includes simulation of water and nutrient transport for the upper Floridian aquifer and FACETS (Floridan Aquifer Collaborative Engagement for Sustainability).

Keywords:
Smart irrigation; decision support systems; machine learning for groundwater forecasting; precision irrigation; nutrient management; Floridian aquifer; IrrigMonitor; water conservation.
