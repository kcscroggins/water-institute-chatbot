Research Focus:
Dr. Sivaramakrishnan "Bala" Balachandar is a globally recognized fluid mechanist and Distinguished Professor at the University of Florida. His research centers on fundamental and computational aspects of fluid mechanics, with particular strengths in turbulent flows and transition theory, multiphase flows (interactions between fluids and particles), environmental fluid dynamics, large-scale simulations and high-performance computing (HPC), data-driven and machine-learning approaches for flow problems, and shock-particle interaction and complex multiphysics applications. His group's work spans both industrial and environmental systems, from fuel sprays to volcanic plume dynamics, sediment transport, gravity currents, and airborne droplet transport relevant to indoor air quality.
