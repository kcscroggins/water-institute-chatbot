Research Focus:
Dr. Nosrat is an operations research and systems optimization scholar whose work focuses on stochastic optimization, decision-making under uncertainty, risk-aware optimization, and data-driven systems design, with applications spanning energy systems, supply chains, infrastructure, and sustainability-oriented decision problems. She develops optimization and decision frameworks that are directly usable by engineers, planners, and policymakers dealing with complex, uncertain systems. Research systems include engineered systems subject to uncertainty (e.g., infrastructure, energy, logistics), decision environments where risk, variability, and trade-offs are central, and cross-sectoral applications.

Notable Publications:
- Optimization models that explicitly incorporate uncertainty and risk
- Stochastic programming for complex engineered systems
- Trade-off analysis across cost, reliability, and system performance
- Algorithmic approaches for large-scale decision problems

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Nosrat develops optimization frameworks that enable evidence-based, risk-sensitive decision making in infrastructure and resource systems, supporting more robust environmental and sustainability planning when integrated with domain science. Her expertise in stochastic and risk-aware optimization is highly relevant as an enabling methodology for nutrient management planning under uncertainty, watershed or agricultural system optimization, and trade-off analysis between productivity, environmental risk, and cost. If coupled with domain science (soil, hydrology, agronomy), her models can support optimal fertilizer or nutrient application strategies, resource allocation under climate and hydrologic uncertainty, and risk-sensitive environmental decision making.
