Education:
- Ph.D. Landscape Ecology/Environmental Science
- Research focus on human-natural systems and sustainability science

Research Focus:
Dr. Qiu is known for landscape ecology and sustainability science, with a strong emphasis on human-natural system interactions, land-use change, ecosystem services, and spatial decision-making. His work integrates ecological processes with social, economic, and policy drivers to understand and improve environmental outcomes at landscape to regional scales. He employs spatial modeling and GIS-based analysis, scenario analysis for land-use and policy decisions, integrated ecological-social system models, and quantitative synthesis of environmental and socioeconomic data. Research systems include forested and mixed-use landscapes, human-dominated ecosystems, and regional to landscape-scale environmental systems often U.S.-focused with broader applicability.

Notable Publications:
- Quantifying ecosystem services under land-use change
- Trade-offs between conservation, development, and human well-being
- Spatially explicit decision frameworks for sustainability planning
- Publications in Landscape Ecology, Ecological Indicators, Sustainability Science, and Ecosystem Services

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Qiu's research informs land-use and conservation decisions by quantifying ecological trade-offs and sustainability outcomes across alternative planning and policy scenarios. He provides systems-level insight into how land-use decisions reshape ecological function and human well-being, helping align conservation and development goals. His work operates at the intersection of ecology, land use, and human decision-making, providing tools and frameworks for understanding and managing environmental systems at scales relevant to policy and planning. His research influences spatial planning and land-use policy, ecosystem service valuation and trade-off analysis, and decision-support tools for sustainability.
