Subject Areas:
Aquatic Animal Health, Fish Pathology, Aquaculture, Water Quality Management, Disease Diagnostics, Extension Education

Research Focus:
Ruth Francis-Floyd is a nationally recognized aquatic animal health veterinarian whose work focuses on fish health, aquaculture systems, disease diagnostics, and water quality management. Her research areas include aquatic animal health and pathology, aquaculture systems management, fish disease diagnosis and prevention, water quality management for aquaculture, Extension education for producers and agencies, and risk communication for aquatic health. She explains how water chemistry, nutrients, and management practices directly affect fish health, disease risk, and system sustainability, translating veterinary and aquatic science into practical guidance for producers, Extension agents, regulators, and hobbyists.
