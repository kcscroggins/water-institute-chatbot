Education:
- Ph.D. Biological and Environmental Engineering, Cornell University (2015)

Research Focus:
Dr. Bayabil's research and extension program focuses on developing practical and sustainable water management practices that conserve water and improve water quality in agricultural and urban areas. His work includes variable rate irrigation (VRI) technology, impacts of saltwater intrusion and flooding on agricultural soils, and irrigation systems for tropical and subtropical fruit crops.

Notable Achievements:
- USDA/NIFA grant for integrating data from ground measurements, UAVs, and modeling to quantify evapotranspiration
- Half million dollar NIFA grant to assess saltwater intrusion impacts in agricultural areas
- 2020 Florida Section ASABE Outstanding Young Researcher Award

Keywords:
Water resources management; precision irrigation; variable rate irrigation; saltwater intrusion; evapotranspiration; tropical agriculture; soil salinity; water quality.
