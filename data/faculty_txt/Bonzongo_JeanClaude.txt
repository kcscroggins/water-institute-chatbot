Research Focus:
Jean-Claude Bonzongo is a leading environmental chemist and biogeochemist internationally recognized for his work on trace metals, especially mercury (Hg), in aquatic and terrestrial systems. His research focuses on how contaminants behave once they enter natural systems, including mercury biogeochemistry (methylation, demethylation), sediment-water interactions, bioavailability and bioaccumulation, atmospheric deposition and watershed transport, aquatic food webs, and trace-metal contamination in tropical, temperate, and engineered systems. His work spans field studies, laboratory experiments, and analytical method development. He explains how toxic metals move, transform, and accumulate in real ecosystems, providing the mechanistic science behind mercury transformation, bioaccumulation, and exposure risk in water bodies.
