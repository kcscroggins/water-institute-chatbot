Research Focus:
Dr. Slinn is internationally known for his fundamental contributions to fluid mechanics, environmental flow processes, and coastal/ocean engineering, particularly in turbulence, wave motion, aerosols and atmospheric dispersion, shoreline and surfzone dynamics, and multiphase flows in natural systems. His work parlayed rigorous physical and applied mathematical modeling into better understanding and prediction of how environmental flows interact with sediments, coastal structures, and the atmosphere. He employs theoretical and mathematical modeling of fluid flow, experimental and field validations of coastal and environmental fluid processes, integration of physical models with environmental systems, and development of transport and dispersion algorithms for environmental engineering. Research systems include surfzone and coastal wave zones, estuarine flows and sediment boundaries, atmospheric boundary layer processes that influence coastal transport, and natural and engineered interfaces such as shorelines and breakwaters.

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Slinn's research underpins predictive models of environmental transport, informing coastal engineering, hazard assessment, and dispersion modeling efforts that support environmental risk management and resilience planning. His work provides foundational physical process understanding including turbulence, wave dynamics, and dispersion that is essential for interpreting how coastal and atmospheric flows influence transport of sediments, nutrients, pollutants, and energy in environmental systems. His work influences wave and boundary layer dynamics, sediment and pollutant transport mechanics, environmental dispersion and coastal interaction models, and theory applied in coastal resilience and risk frameworks.
