Dr. Adams is a Professor of Natural Resource Economics and Policy and serves as Associate Dean for Research within UF/IFAS. His research centers on non-market valuation of ecosystem goods and services, particularly related to forests and natural resources. He studies how people value ecosystem services, how preferences and attitudes affect those values, and how this information can inform policy decisions. His work uses survey-based data, econometric and bioeconomic modeling, and non-market valuation methods to address topics such as invasive species management, conservation policy, carbon sequestration, water resources, and economic valuation of natural resources.
