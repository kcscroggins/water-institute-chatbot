Water Institute Relevance:
While Dr. Liu's core domain is computational materials and machine learning for chemistry and polymer science, her expertise in AI/ML integrated with physical theory represents advanced computational capacity that could be adapted for predictive environmental modeling frameworks if integrated across disciplines. Her methodologies (ML + DFT) are generalizable modeling approaches that contribute broadly to computational science methodologies in interdisciplinary contexts, potentially applicable to environmental and water-related modeling challenges.

Role in Research-to-Policy Pipeline:
Research producer (primary). Generates computational tools and theoretical predictions that inform materials design, with potential downstream use in technology and materials sectors. Develops predictive computational frameworks that improve materials discovery workflows and inform data-driven design strategies.

Strategic Value:
Answers the question: "How can data-driven methods (machine learning + physics) accelerate accurate predictions of complex molecular or materials properties?" Influences development of machine learning tools linked with physical models, acceleration of materials and molecular discovery, and cross-disciplinary adoption of AI/DFT approaches that may inform computational environmental science.
