Research Focus:
Mark Clark is a soil scientist and biogeochemist whose work focuses on soil organic matter, nutrient cycling, and soil health in managed and agricultural ecosystems. His research integrates soil chemistry, biology, and management, including soil organic matter dynamics, carbon sequestration and stabilization, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, soil health indicators, and linkages between soils and water quality. He studies how carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus move through soils and how management practices alter those processes. His work combines field experiments, laboratory analyses, and ecosystem modeling.
