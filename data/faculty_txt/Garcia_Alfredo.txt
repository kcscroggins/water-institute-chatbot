Research Focus:
Alfredo Garcia is an operations research scholar specializing in optimization and decision-making under uncertainty for complex, resource-constrained systems. His research areas include operations research and optimization, stochastic and robust decision-making, resource allocation under uncertainty, risk-aware systems design, and infrastructure and network optimization. His work focuses on how to allocate limited resources optimally when systems are dynamic, uncertain, and multi-objective, developing formal decision and optimization frameworks that are implemented by engineers, planners, and policymakers.

Selected Publications:
- Foundational work in stochastic optimization and control addressing decisions under uncertainty and incomplete information
- Research on risk-sensitive and robust optimization for safety-critical and resource-constrained systems
- Generalizable mathematical tools used across infrastructure, environmental, and operational contexts
