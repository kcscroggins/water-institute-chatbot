Research Focus:
Austin Evans is a chemist whose work sits at the intersection of chemical analysis, molecular processes, and environmental or materials-relevant chemistry. His research emphasizes chemical mechanisms and measurements that are foundational for understanding environmental transformations, reactivity, and contaminant behavior. His research areas include chemical reaction mechanisms, analytical and instrumental chemistry, molecular transformations relevant to environmental systems, chemical pathways affecting pollutant fate, and laboratory-based experimental chemistry. His work is typically upstream and enabling rather than policy-facing, but critical for validating assumptions used in environmental and nutrient models.
