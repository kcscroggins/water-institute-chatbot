Research Focus:
Dr. Kevin Bardosh is an applied medical anthropologist and implementation scientist whose work bridges social science and global health. His research focuses on the biosocial dynamics of health and disease, infectious diseases and emerging pathogens, community-based and participatory approaches to public health interventions, implementation science and health systems, environmental anthropology and development studies, and zoonotic disease governance.
