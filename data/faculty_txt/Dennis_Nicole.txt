Research Focus:
Nicole Dennis is an environmental health scientist and exposure toxicologist whose work focuses on cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs), cyanotoxins (e.g., microcystins), and human health risk from waterborne contaminants. Her research areas include cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (HABs), cyanotoxins (microcystins, cylindrospermopsin, saxitoxins), human exposure pathways (drinking water, recreation, aerosols), environmental epidemiology, risk assessment and public health thresholds, and climate-water-health interactions. Her work directly connects nutrient enrichment of waters to public-health consequences.
