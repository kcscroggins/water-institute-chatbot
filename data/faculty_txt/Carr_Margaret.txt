Research Focus:
Margaret Carr is a landscape architect and urban systems thinker whose work focuses on how landscapes can be designed to support environmental performance, resilience, and livability, especially in urban and suburban contexts. Her work sits at the intersection of landscape design, urban ecology, and environmental planning, including urban stormwater and green infrastructure, landscape performance and resilience, climate-responsive urban design, public space and environmental function, human-environment interaction, and spatial planning for sustainability. Her work emphasizes how design decisions influence environmental outcomes, especially water movement, heat, and habitat. She bridges environmental goals, spatial design, and everyday use, ensuring that policy intent survives implementation at the design stage.
