Research Focus:
Patrick Inglett is a soil and aquatic biogeochemist specializing in carbon and nutrient cycling driven by microbial and hydrologic processes. His research areas include soil and aquatic biogeochemistry, carbon cycling and greenhouse gas dynamics, nitrogen and phosphorus transformations, microbial ecology of soils and sediments, and wetland and aquatic ecosystem processes. His work is especially influential in understanding biogeochemical transformations under changing hydrologic and nutrient conditions, generating process-level evidence that informs wetland restoration, nutrient management, and water-quality regulation.

Selected Publications:
- Extensive body of work on nutrient cycling, microbial processes, and carbon dynamics in wetland and aquatic systems
- Studies on nitrogen transformations and organic matter decomposition under varying hydrologic regimes
- Contributions to Biogeochemistry, Journal of Environmental Quality, Wetlands, and Soil Biology & Biochemistry
