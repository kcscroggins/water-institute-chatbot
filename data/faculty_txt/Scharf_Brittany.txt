Subject Areas:
Sustainable fisheries and aquatic resource stewardship, Coastal and marine habitats (seagrass reef and estuarine systems), Natural resource education and outreach, Community science and environmental literacy, Extension-driven coastal resilience programming

Education:
- Ph.D. Marine Science/Coastal Resources
- Focus on marine extension and coastal education

Program Focus:
Dr. Hall-Scharf is known for her role as a marine extension specialist and coastal resource educator, leading community-focused programming on sustainable fisheries, healthy coastal environments, resilient communities, environmental literacy, and workforce development. She bridges marine science knowledge with stakeholder outreach and practical stewardship actions, particularly in Florida's coastal and nearshore ecosystems. She employs educational workshops field programs and community engagement, citizen science coordination such as Horseshoe Crab Watch, extension publications and fact sheets, and development of best-practice guidance for stakeholders. Program systems include Florida's nearshore and coastal marine ecosystems, recreational anglers coastal residents and shoreline stakeholders, and local communities in Hernando and adjacent coastal counties.

Program Activities:
- Volunteers Keeping Tabs on Superheroes of the Sea: Florida's Adventure Coast (2022) - published in Fisheries detailing citizen science program engaging volunteers to monitor horseshoe crabs
- Extension publications and fact sheets on bay scallop harvesting practices and sustainable fisheries topics
- Extension articles addressing coastal cleanup events, habitat restoration, and recreational fisheries topics

Extension Impact:
Her outputs are practical, community-oriented, and directly support decision-making and behavior change among coastal users rather than standard academic citation metrics alone. She connects academic and agency science to public understanding and on-the-ground stewardship, helping communities adopt sustainable practices and participate in science that informs resource management.

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Hall-Scharf's work supports sustainable coastal resource use and resilience by translating marine science into actionable guidance and community engagement, enabling better stewardship decisions by stakeholders. While her role is centered on extension and outreach, it directly engages with coastal ecosystems and sustainable use of marine resources, influencing how science is applied at the community and stakeholder level. Her work influences community engagement and citizen science, sustainable fisheries and coastal habitat guidance, and environmental literacy and stewardship behavior.
