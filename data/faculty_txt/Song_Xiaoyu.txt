Research Focus:
Dr. Song is known for his innovative theoretical and computational modeling in geomechanics, especially focused on multiphysics and multiscale numerical modeling of porous geomaterials, including strain localization, failure mechanisms in unsaturated soils, and advanced periporomechanics frameworks. His work addresses mechanical behavior and instability in soils and geomaterials under complex loading and environmental conditions, integrating high-performance computing, nonlocal models, and multiphysics coupling across length scales. He employs advanced numerical techniques and meshfree methods for porous media mechanics, periporomechanics frameworks bridging micro to macro-scale behavior, high-performance computing for large-scale geomechanical simulations, and finite element and nonlocal continuum methods for slope stability and soil failure. Research systems include unsaturated soils and porous geomaterials and three-phase porous media, slope stability and geohazard contexts influenced by environmental loads, and computational frameworks applicable to infrastructure resilience in variable environmental settings.

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Song's research enhances predictive capabilities for soil and infrastructure failure under environmental stresses, providing rigorous computational methods relevant to hazard mitigation, resilient design, and geotechnical risk assessment. His work advances fundamental understanding of soil mechanics and failure processes, which is crucial for predicting soil strength and stability under environmental loads, including water content changes and climate stressors, and informs infrastructure resilience, landslide risk, and environmental geotechnics. His work influences computational and numerical methods for geomechanics, soil instability and failure prediction under environmental load, and use of HPC in civil and environmental engineering challenges.
