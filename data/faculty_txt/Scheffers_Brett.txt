Research Focus:
Dr. Scheffers is internationally recognized for global-scale conservation biology and climate-change ecology, particularly for showing how climate change, microclimates, habitat structure, and human pressures jointly reshape biodiversity from genes to ecosystems. He is a central figure in demonstrating that fine-scale thermal heterogeneity (microhabitats, forest canopies, soil and near-surface temperatures) can buffer or fail to buffer organisms from climate extremes, with major implications for extinction risk, conservation planning, and human well-being. He employs global meta-analysis and synthesis, large collaborative datasets across multiple taxa and regions, integration of field ecology with climate and spatial data, trait-based and phylogenetic vulnerability analyses, and cross-scale approaches from microhabitats to biomes to people. Research systems include tropical forests especially Southeast Asia and the tropics broadly, global biodiversity patterns across terrestrial systems, and multi-taxon analyses including amphibians reptiles birds mammals and invertebrates.

Policy Relevance:
Dr. Scheffers's research reshapes how conservation planning accounts for climate exposure, showing that habitat structure, microclimates, and human pressures critically mediate extinction risk under climate change. He provides foundational, cross-scale insight into how climate change interacts with ecology and habitat structure to drive biodiversity loss, making his work central to modern conservation science. His work defines the ecological constraints and exposure pathways through which climate change, habitat loss, and human pressure affect biodiversity, informing conservation priorities and adaptation strategies. His research papers are field-defining and frequently cited in IPBES, IPCC-adjacent, and conservation policy contexts. His work influences climate adaptation framing for biodiversity, conservation prioritization and vulnerability assessment, and integration of microclimate and habitat structure into policy and planning.
