Research Focus:
Edward Evans is a leading agricultural economist specializing in specialty crop markets, farm profitability, risk management, and economic impacts of policy and environmental change, with a strong focus on South Florida tropical and subtropical agriculture. His research areas include agricultural and resource economics, specialty crop production economics, farm profitability and cost structures, risk, uncertainty, and resilience, economic impacts of pests, diseases, and climate, policy and regulation impacts on growers, and technology and practice adoption. His work explains why growers do or don't adopt practices, translating biophysical constraints (water, nutrients, pests, climate) into producer behavior, market outcomes, and policy tradeoffs.
