Policy Relevance:
Dr. Sandoval Gutierrez's work contributes evidence-based insight into how social networks and economic behavior affect individual and policy outcomes, supporting better design and evaluation of economic and social policy interventions. He provides empirical understanding of how social and economic interactions shape behavior and outcomes, which is fundamental for designing effective economic policies and evaluating their impacts. His research does not directly address biophysical environmental processes, but contributes to understanding economic behavior and social interactions relevant to policy evaluation and economic decision-making in broader environmental and resource contexts where human behavior and incentives matter. His work influences economic behavior and policy evaluation, applied microeconomic analysis, and interpretation of social and peer effects in economic contexts.
