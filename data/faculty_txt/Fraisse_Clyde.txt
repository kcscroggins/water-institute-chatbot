Research Focus:
Clyde Fraisse is a leading agricultural climatologist and climate-risk engineer specializing in climate variability, seasonal forecasting, decision support, and adaptation for agriculture. His work translates weather and climate signals into actionable management decisions for farmers, Extension, and policymakers. His research areas include agricultural climatology, seasonal climate forecasting, climate risk and decision support, crop-climate interactions, water management under climate variability, climate adaptation for agriculture, and Extension decision tools including AgroClimate. His work underpins climate-informed BMPs across Florida and the Southeast.
