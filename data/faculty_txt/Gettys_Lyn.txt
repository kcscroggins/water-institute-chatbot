Research Focus:
Lyn Gettys is an aquatic and wetland plant ecologist and extension specialist focused on integrated management of invasive aquatic weeds and restoration of native aquatic plants in Florida water systems. Her research areas include aquatic and wetland plant ecology, integrated aquatic weed management (chemical, biological, cultural), native aquatic plant culture and restoration, effects of nutrients and environmental conditions on aquatic vegetation, and Extension delivery of best management practices for aquatic systems. Her work blends fundamental plant ecology with applied control and restoration techniques relevant to aquatic ecosystems.
