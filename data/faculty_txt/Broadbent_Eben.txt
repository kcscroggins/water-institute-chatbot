Research Focus:
Eben Broadbent is a forest ecologist and remote-sensing scientist internationally recognized for his work on forest disturbance, land-use change, and ecosystem recovery, especially in tropical forests. His research integrates ecology, geospatial analysis, and climate science, covering tropical forest ecology, deforestation and forest degradation, land-use and land-cover change, forest carbon dynamics, disturbance and recovery trajectories, remote sensing (Landsat, MODIS, LiDAR), and coupled human-natural systems. He quantifies how forests respond to human disturbance and climate stress using satellite data, LiDAR, and long-term field studies, combining satellite time series with field plots for causal inference about disturbance and recovery.
