Research Focus:
Basil Iannone is a forest ecologist specializing in disturbance, invasive species, and long-term ecosystem change in managed and natural forests. His research areas include forest and ecosystem ecology, disturbance regimes (fire, storms, land-use change), invasive species impacts, long-term ecological change and resilience, and human-environment interactions in forest systems. His work provides empirical and conceptual evidence that informs forest management, conservation planning, and restoration policy, explaining how human activities, invasive species, climate stressors, and management interventions reshape forest structure and function over time.

Selected Publications:
- Peer-reviewed research on long-term forest change and disturbance-driven dynamics integrating historical and modern data
- Studies examining how invasive species and altered disturbance regimes affect forest composition and ecosystem services
- Conceptual work connecting human decision-making to ecological outcomes in forested landscapes

Water & Policy Relevance:
- Forest disturbance regulating soil carbon storage and nutrient retention
- Biogeochemical cycling affected by management and disturbance
- Changes in forest structure affecting erosion, runoff, and nutrient delivery
- Forest management strategies for ecosystem resilience
- Conservation planning under climate and disturbance risk
- Long-term ecosystem resilience assessments
- Human-driven disturbances altering nutrient retention capacity
- Invasive species effects on forest ecosystem function
