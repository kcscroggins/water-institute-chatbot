Research Focus:
Nicholas Comerford is a soil scientist and forest biogeochemist internationally recognized for his work on nutrient cycling, soil fertility, and plant-soil interactions, especially in tropical and subtropical forest systems. His expertise centers on below-ground processes explaining how roots, microbes, and soil chemistry control nutrient availability, carbon storage, and nutrient losses in managed and natural ecosystems. His research areas include soil nutrient cycling (N, P, Ca, Mg), soil organic matter and carbon dynamics, forest and agroforestry soils, root-soil-microbe interactions, nutrient limitation and fertilization effects, and tropical forest biogeochemistry.
