Research Focus:
Dr. Allen is a Professor of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences and Director of the UF/IFAS Nature Coast Biological Station (NCBS) in Cedar Key, FL. His research program evaluates fish population and fish community responses to changes in fishing mortality, habitat, and species interactions. He and his students evaluate the efficacy of various management strategies for improving and sustaining fisheries. Research areas include fish population dynamics and ecology, sustainable harvest approaches, habitat requirements and ecological responses for both freshwater and coastal fisheries, and effects of fishing mortality, invasive species, and environmental change on fish communities. He uses field studies, modeling techniques, and applied research to inform fisheries conservation and management in Florida and beyond.
