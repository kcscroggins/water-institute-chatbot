Education:
- PhD in Marine Biosciences, University of Delaware
- M.S. in Biology, West Chester University
- B.S. in Biology with Spanish minor, Salisbury University
- B.S. in Marine & Environmental Science, University of Maryland Eastern Shore

Research Focus:
Dr. Meyer's work sits at the intersection of microbial ecology and bioinformatics. Her research investigates microbial communities underpinning Florida and Caribbean habitats in need of conservation and/or restoration such as seagrass beds and coral reefs. She examines how microbiomes structure and impact ecosystem functions.

Teaching:
- Soil Microbial Ecology
- Ecology of Waterborne Pathogens

Keywords:
Microbial ecology; bioinformatics; seagrass ecosystems; coral reef conservation; microbiome research; wetlands and aquatic ecosystems; waterborne pathogens.
