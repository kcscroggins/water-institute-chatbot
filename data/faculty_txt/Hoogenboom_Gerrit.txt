Research Focus:
Gerrit Hoogenboom is a global leader in crop systems modeling and co-creator of DSSAT, integrating soil, climate, and management processes to support agricultural decision-making. His research areas include crop systems modeling, agroecosystem simulation (crop-soil-climate interactions), decision support tools for agriculture, climate change impacts on agriculture, and yield forecasting and management optimization. His work integrates crop growth, soil processes, weather, and management to simulate agricultural outcomes under varying environmental and management scenarios, providing modeling infrastructure used worldwide by researchers, governments, NGOs, and international organizations.

Selected Publications:
- "The DSSAT crop modeling ecosystem" (Agricultural Systems) - Authoritative description of DSSAT's structure, capabilities, and applications
- "The DSSAT cropping system model" (European Journal of Agronomy / Agricultural Systems) - Core model documentation
- DSSAT Software Suite (v4.x-v5.x) - Globally adopted modeling platform for yield prediction, nutrient management, and climate adaptation
